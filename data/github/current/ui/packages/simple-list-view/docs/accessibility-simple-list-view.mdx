# Simple ListView

## Overview of Simple ListView assistive technology considerations

### Adaptable underlying semantic structure

The underlying markup for a Simple ListView is designed to adapt to the amount of content each ListItem contains. A Simple ListView will use either:

1. An `ul` element, with child `li` elements, or
2. A `table` element, with child `th` and `td` elements.

This allows its content to be quickly understood, and navigated by assistive technology in ways that match user expectations.

Further documentation about how `ul` or `table` selection is supplied in the following [underlying semantic structure for ListItem content](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#underlying-semantic-structure-for-containing-listitem-content) subsection.

### Data collection

A Simple ListView component instance can be:

1. Used to present information that does not transmit data back into GitHub or other applicable systems,
2. A standalone data collection experience, or
3. Part of a larger data collection experience.

Depending on how the Simple ListView component instance is used, its underlying will need to adapt in order to pass data to the appropriate system.

Reference the [error validation documentation](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-error-validation--docs) for more information.

#### Conditionally toggled `form` element

1. No `form` element is needed if the Simple ListView is used to present information that does not transmit data back into GitHub or other applicable systems.
2. A `form` element is needed if the Simple ListView is a standalone data collection experience. Its attributes help to communicate where and how to communicate the content it collects, as well as announce the form's purpose to assistive technology.
3. A `form` element will also not be used if the Simple ListView is part of a larger data collection experience. Here, the `form` element is declared as a parent element elsewhere in the DOM. The Simple ListView component instance will still utilize structures such as `fieldset` and `legend` elements to help organize the content, as it is part of a larger form experience.

#### Associating a Simple ListView's content with a form if the component instance cannot be placed within a `form` element

Authors should strive to make the Simple ListView instance a child of the `form` element if at all possible.

If this cannot be done, each element that performs data collection needs to be associated with the `form` element's `id`. This can be accomplished via [the `form` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#form).

### Responsive tables

Attempting to alter a `table` element's display via CSS will affect its underlying semantics. This will create an issue, where the table content is mis-announced and potentially have its expected interaction subverted.

To accommodate this, three things must happen for narrow viewports:

1. The table's internal elements need to have their [display properties adjusted via CSS](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#adjusting-the-tables-display-via-css),
2. [ARIA attributes also need to be applied](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#adjusting-the-tables-semantics-via-aria) to the table's internal elements, and
3. The [skiplink](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#skiplink)'s string must be updated to match the announced semantics.

## Container

<img alt="An empty white recangle that suggests the generic content area a Simple ListView component can contain." src={imageContainer} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

A Simple ListView needs a container that can express the boundaries of its content. This container communicates the boundary area that the Simple ListView UI is placed in.

### Container and data collection

The Simple ListView container is:

1. A `div` element if the Simple ListView:
   * Does not transmit data back into GitHub or other applicable systems.
   * Is part of a larger data collection experience, where the `form` element is declared as a parent element elsewhere in the DOM.
2. `div` and `form` elements if the Simple ListView is a standalone data collection experience.

### Container example markup when not part of a data collection experience, or part of a larger data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
</div>
```

* A UUID is applied to the `div` element.

### Container example markup when it is a standalone data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <form
    id="uuid-form"
    aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <fieldset>
      <!-- Simple ListView title -->
    </fieldset>
      <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
  </form>
</div>
```

* A `form` element is declared as an immediate child of the wrapper `div` element.
  * An `id` is declared on the `form` element, with a UUID prefixed value.
  * `aria-labelledby` is also declared on the `form` element to associate the form with [the Simple ListView's title](#title).
* A `fieldset` element is declared as an immediate child of the `form` element.
  * The browser default border styling for the `fieldset` element can be removed via CSS.

## Title

<img alt="An empty white recangle with a smaller thin, light purple rectangle placed above it. The thin purple rectandle suggests the title area for the component." src={imageTitle} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

A title provides the Simple ListView with a concise, descriptive name that communicates what kind of content it contains.

### Title visibility

A title can be configured to be either:

* Hidden visually, but still accessible to assistive technology, or
* Shown to all users.

Removing [the `sr-only` class](https://primer.style/foundations/css-utilities/layout#screen-reader-only) declared on the heading element will make the title visible to all users.

### Title and data collection

The Simple ListView title is either:

1. A heading element if the Simple ListView does not transmit data back into GitHub or other applicable systems.
2. A heading element placed inside a `legend` element if the Simple ListView is part of a data collection experience.

### Title example markup when not part of a data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <hX
    id="uuid-title"
    class="sr-only">
    {title}
  </hX>
  <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
</div>
```

* The `X` in the `hX` element is a placeholder used to indicate the heading level.
  * The heading's level should be adjustable by the component author.
  * The heading level in most circumstances should should increment by 1 based on the heading level placed before it in the DOM.
  * For example, the heading used for the Simple ListView's container title should be a `h3` if the previous heading is a `h2`.
* An `id` with a UUID prefix is added to the heading element.
* A class of `sr-only` is applied to the heading element.
  * This visually hides the heading, but ensures it is discoverable for screen readers for use as a navigational aid.
* The `{title}` in the heading element is a placeholder for a component author-supplied string.
  * The title should concisely describe the overall Simple ListView instance's purpose.

### Title example markup when it is a standalone data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <form id="uuid-form" aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <fieldset class="sr-only">
      <legend>
        <hX id="uuid-title">
          {title}
        </hX>
      </legend>
      <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
    </fieldset>
  </form>
</div>
```

* The `sr-only` class has been removed from the heading element and is instead applied to the parent `fieldset` element.
* The `id` on the heading element is preserved.

### Title example markup when part of a larger data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <fieldset class="sr-only">
    <legend>
      <hX id="uuid-title">
        {title}
      </hX>
    <legend>
    <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
  </fieldset>
</div>
```

* The `form` element has been removed, as the Simple ListView's markup are all child elements of a `form` declared higher up in the DOM.

## Description

<img alt="An empty white recangle with a smaller thin light blue rectangle placed between it and a smaller thin, light purple rectangle. The thin blue rectandle suggests the subtitle area for the component." src={imageDescription} />

This subcomponent is **optional**.

A description provides the Simple ListView with additional high-level information or instructions that are relevant to the content contained within the Simple ListView component instance.

Description content is restricted to paragraphs or lists of text. Text content can contain links (ex: linking to support material), buttons (ex: toggletips), and text-level styling (ex: bold, italic, etc). It should not contain more complicated interactive experiences such as form inputs.

### Description example markup when not part of a data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <hX id="uuid-title" class="sr-only">{title}</hX>
  <p>{description}</p>
  <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
</div>
```

* `{description}` is a placeholder for a component author-supplied string.
* In this example a `p` element is used, but `ul` or `ol` with accompanying `li` elements could also be used if the content requires it.
* [Primer's utility styles](https://primer.style/foundations/css-utilities/getting-started) can be used to style the subtitle content.

### Description example markup when a standalone data collection experience or part of a larger data collection experience

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <form id="uuid-form" aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <fieldset>
      <legend>
        <hX id="uuid-title">
          {title}
        </hX>
      </legend>
    </fieldset>
    <p>{subtitle}</p>
    <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
  </form>
</div>
```

* The description is placed after the closing `fieldset` element.
* Note that the `form` element is only used if the Simple ListView is a standalone data collection experience.

## Skiplink

<img alt="An empty white recangle with two thin, short light green rectangles. The first is placed immediately before the white rectangle, and the second is placed immediately after. A line connects the two rectangles to imply the skiplink's jumping behavior." src={imageSkiplink} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

A skiplink allows users to quickly bypass the Simple ListView's content and jump to the content that immediately follows the component instance. This is helpful for keyboard-only users where repetitive keypresses (including <kbd>Tab</kbd>) could be painful and time-consuming.

Skiplinks are used regardless of if the Simple ListView is part of a data collection experience or not.

There are two parts to a skiplink:

1. The skiplink itself, and
2. The target element that the skiplink jumps to.

### Skiplink example markup

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <hX id="uuid-title" class="sr-only">{title}</hX>
  <p>{subtitle}</p>
  <a
    class="sr-only show-on-focus"
    href="#uuid-list-end">
    Skip {table/list}: {title}
  </a>
  <!-- Simple ListView internals -->
  <p
    id="uuid-list-end"
    class="sr-only show-on-focus"
    tabindex="-1">
    End of {table/list}: {title}.
  </p>
</div>
```

* A `a` element is placed after the [title](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#title) and [subtitle](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#subtitle) (if used), and before the [ListItem content](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs).
  * The `a` element's string content reads `"Skip {table/list}: "`, where `{table/list}` is a placeholder for if "table" or "list" is used. Use "table" if the ListItem content is structured as a `table` element, and "list" if the ListItem content is structured as a `ul` element. Reference the [Underlying semantic structure for containing ListItem content](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#underlying-semantic-structure-for-containing-listitem-content) subsection for more information.
    * Also note the space after the colon in the string content (`:␣`).
  * Classes of `sr-only` and `show-on-focus` hide the skiplink visually, but ensure it is announced by screen readers and becomes visible when focused.
  * `aria-labelledby` is declared on the `a` element to associate the skiplink with the Simple ListView's [title](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#title).
    * This works in conjunction with the link's text string that reads "Skip list:" to communicate to the user that a table or list are present, and then which table or list will be bypassed.
  * The `a` element's `href` attribute is set to the `id` of the target element that the skiplink navigates to.
* A `p` element is placed after the ListItem content, and before [the Simple ListView container](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#container)'s closing `div`.
  * The `p` element's string content reads `"End of {table/list}: {title}"`, where `{table/list}` is a placeholder for if "table" or "list" is used. Use "table" if the ListItem content is structured as a `table` element, and "list" if the ListItem content is structured as a `ul` element. `{title}` is a placeholder for the [Simple ListView's title](#title).
  * An `id` attribute is declared on the `p` element, with a UUID prefixed value.
  * Classes of `sr-only` and `show-on-focus` hide the `p` element content visually, but ensure it is announced by screen readers and becomes visible when focused.
  * A declaration of `tabindex="-1"` is used to ensure the `p` element can be focused as a target of the skiplink.

## Underlying semantic structure for containing ListItem content

Simple ListView ListItems can be structured in one of two ways:

1. As `li` elements within a `ul` element, or
2. As `td` elements within a `table` element.

Simple ListView ListItems are placed within a `form` element if data collection is required, regardless of if a `ul` or `table` element is used.

### Determining if a `ul` or `table` element is used

The choice between using a `ul` or `table` element is determined by the content contained within [the ListItem](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs).

#### When to use a `ul` element

<img alt="An white recangle filled with 5 light blue rectangles in such a way as to suggest list items." src={imageList} />

A `ul` element is used when the ListItem contains **only one** [secondary action](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-secondary-action-and-information). In this scenario, all ListItem content is placed within `li` elements.

##### `ul` element approach example markup

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <!-- Simple ListView title -->
  <!-- Simple ListView subtitle -->
  <!-- Simple ListView skiplink -->
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <!-- ListItem title and title action -->
        <!-- ListItem description -->
        <!-- ListItem secondary action -->
      </li>
      <!-- Additional ListItems -->
    </ul>
  </div>
  <!-- Simple ListView skiplink target -->
</div>
```

* A `div` element is used as a parent container for the `ul` element. This is not required, but could be helpful for styling purposes.
* A `ul` element is added as a direct child of the `div` element.
* `li` elements are added as direct child elements of the `ul` element.
  * Each Simple ListView [ListItem](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs)'s content is placed within a `li` element.

#### When to use a `table` element

<img alt="An white recangle filled with a grid of 4 columns and 7 rows of light purple rectangles in such a way as to suggest a table. The topmost row uses a slightly darker rectangle color to suggest a table header row." src={imageTable} />

A `table` element is used when the ListItem contains **more than one** [secondary action](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-secondary-action-and-information). In this scenario, ListItem content is placed within `td` elements.

Note that the component author **must** supply title strings for each table column header. The title should concisely describe the content of the column. The entire table header can optionally be visually hidden by the component author.

`th` elements are used to declare the column headers. Each secondary action **must** have its own dedicated column header. Multiple secondary actions **should not** be placed within the same column header.

##### `table` element approach example markup

```html
<div id="uuid">
  <!-- Simple ListView title -->
  <!-- Simple ListView subtitle -->
  <!-- Simple ListView skiplink -->
  <div>
    <table aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
      <thead class="sr-only">
        <tr>
          <th
            id="uuid-row00-col01"
            scope="col">
            <!-- ListItem title/title action, and description column header -->
          </th>
          <th
            id="uuid-row00-col02"
            scope="col">
            <!-- ListItem secondary action column header -->
          </th>
          <th
            id="uuid-row00-col03"
            scope="col">
            <!-- ListItem secondary action column header -->
          </th>
          <!-- Additional secondary action column headers as needed -->
        </tr>
      <thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th
            id="uuid-table-row01-col01"
            scope="row">
            <!-- ListItem title/title action -->
          </th>
          <td id="uuid-table-row01-col02">
            <!-- ListItem secondary action -->
          </td>
          <td id="uuid-table-row01-col03">
            <!-- ListItem secondary action -->
          </td>
          <!-- Additional secondary action column headers as needed -->
        </tr>
        <!-- Additional ListItems -->
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <!-- Simple ListView target -->
</div>
```

* A `div` element is used as a parent container for the `table` element. This is not required, but could be helpful for styling purposes.
* A `table` element is added as a direct child of the `div` element.
  * `aria-labelledby="uuid-title"` is declared on the `table` element to associate the table with [the Simple ListView's title](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#title).
* A `thead` element is placed as an immediate child of the `table` element. This will help assistive technology users understand what is and is not table header content.
  * A class of `sr-only` is declared on the `thead` element if the table row header is set to be hidden. This will visually hide the table header content, but ensure it is announced by screen readers.
* A `tr` element is then placed as an immediate child of the `thead` element. This will help assistive technology users understand that they are on a table header row.
* `th` elements are placed as child elements of the `tr` element.
  * An `id` attribute is declared on each `th` element. The `id`s value uses a UUID prefix and serves as a reference for the table cell.
  * `th` elements are added for the title/title action and description, as well as for each [secondary action](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-secondary-action-and-information).
    * There must be minimum of three `th` elements present. If there is only one secondary action, [use the `ul` treatment instead](#when-to-use-a-ul-element).
* A `tbody` element is placed immediately after the closing `thead` tag.
* A `tr` element is then placed as an immediate child of the `tbody` element. This will help assistive technology users understand that they are on a table header row.
  * `tr` elements are added for each ListItem.
* A `th` element is placed as the first child element of each `tr` element declared inside the `tbody`.
  * An `id` attribute is declared on each `th` element. The `id`s value uses a UUID prefix and serves as a reference for the table cell.
  * The `th` elements contains the [ListItem's title](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-title)/[title action](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-title-action) and [description](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#listitem-description) content.
* `td` elements are placed as sibling elements after the `th` element.
  * An `id` attribute is declared on each `td` element. The `id`s value uses a UUID prefix and serves as a reference for the table cell.
  * Each `td` element contains a secondary action for the ListItem.

### Adjusting the table's display for narrow viewports

Three things need to happen when the Simple ListView is reduced to a single column for narrow viewports:

1. Display properties are adjusted via CSS,
2. ARIA attributes are applied, and
3. Updating the skip link text.

Doing so will ensure that the table's content is announced correctly by assistive technology. This is particularly important for visual screen reader users, who benefit from a match between displayed visuals and assistive technology announcements.

#### Adjusting the table's display via CSS

Table elements need to have their native display properties adjusted via CSS for the [narrow media query](https://primer.style/foundations/layout#viewport-ranges). Following are example declarations:

```css
/* [1] Override underlying HTML table semantics */
/* [2] Restores semantics to create expected announcements */
table {
  display: grid; /* [1] */

  @media screen and (width >= 768px) {
    display: table; /* [2] */
  }
}

thead {
  display: none; /* [1] Remove column announcements on smaller viewports since it won't act like a table */

  @media screen and (width >= 768px) {
    display: table-header-group; /* [2] `thead` row is still visually hidden via the `.sr-only` class */
  }
}

tbody {
  display: block; /* [1] */

  @media screen and (width >= 768px) {
    display: table-row-group; /* [2] */
  }
}

/*
  Note: Using a grid on the tbody tr element is a suggested approach
  for layout of its contents and is not a requirement. If a `display: grid`
  is not used, `display: block` or `display: flex` are acceptable alternatives.
*/
tbody tr {
  display: grid; /* [1] */
  /* Other grid-related declarations */

  @media screen and (width >= 768px) {
    display: table-row; /* [2] */
  }
}

tbody th,
tbody td {
  display: block; /* [1] */

  @media screen and (width >= 768px) {
    display: table-cell; /* [2] */
  }
}
```

#### Adjusting the table's semantics via ARIA

The following ARIA attributes need to be applied to the table's internal elements when the table is displayed as [a single column](https://primer.style/foundations/layout#viewport-ranges):

* `role="list"` is applied to the `table` element.
* `role="listitem"` is applied to each `tr` element inside the `tbody` element.
  * The `thead` `tr` elements are removed from the accessibility tree via the `display: none` declaration.

#### Updating the skip link text

For [narrow breakpoints](https://primer.style/foundations/layout#viewport-ranges):

* "list" replaces "table" in the "`Skip {table/list}: {title}`" string used for the [skiplink](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#skiplink)'s accessible name.
* "list" replaces "table" in the "`End of {table/list}: {title}`" string used for the [skiplink](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-simple-listview--docs#skiplink)'s destination.
