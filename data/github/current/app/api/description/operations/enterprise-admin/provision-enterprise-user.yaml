summary: Provision a SCIM enterprise user
description: |-
  > [!NOTE]
  > The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently in *private* beta and are subject to change.

  Creates an external identity for a new SCIM enterprise user.

  SCIM does not authenticate users, it only provisions them. The authentication of users is done by SAML. However, when SCIM is enabled, all users need to be provisioned through SCIM before a user can sign in through SAML. The matching of a user to a SCIM provisioned user is done when the SAML assertion is consumed. The user will be matched on SAML response `NameID` to SCIM `userName`.

  When converting existing enterprise to use SCIM, the user handle (`userName`) from the SCIM payload will be used to match the provisioned user to an already existing user in the enterprise. Since the new identity record is created for newly provisioned users the matching for those records is done using a user's handle. Currently the matching will be performed to all of the users no matter if they were SAML JIT provisioned or created as local users.

      Creates an external identity for a new SCIM enterprise user.

      SCIM is responsible for user provisioning, not authentication. The actual user authentication is handled by SAML. However, with SCIM enabled, users must first be provisioned via SCIM before they can sign in through SAML.
