# `QueryBuilder`

‚ö†Ô∏è The QueryBuilder was designed to improve accessibility in the global search input,
command palette, and filter inputs on the platform. It's effective at fixing these issues,
but it doesn't standardize filter providers across the platform or [offer advanced filtering features](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-documentation-differences-from-querybuilder--docs)
by default. If your main goal is filtering, you should use the [Filter](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-readme--docs) component in React.
For those using Rails, there are two alternatives: you can either implement the [QueryBuilder element](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/query-builder-element/README.md) directly,
or you can utilize React partials within your Rails applications if you need specific [Filter](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-readme--docs) component features.

## üìù Description

This is a React-wrapped version of the [QueryBuilder element](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/query-builder-element/README.md).

Historically, the creation of this wrapper was initiated by the issues team due to the absence of the [Filter](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-readme--docs) component at that time.
