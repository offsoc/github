Hi <%= @user.safe_profile_name %>,

You’ve been added as <%= @role_for_email %> of the <%= @business.name %> enterprise on GitHub. Head over to <%= enterprise_url @business %> to check out the <%= @business.name %> profile.

Some helpful tips:

- If you get a 404 page, make sure you’re signed in as <%= @user.display_login %>.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
