summary: Get a DNS health check for GitHub Pages
description: |-
  Gets a health check of the DNS settings for the `CNAME` record configured for a repository's GitHub Pages.

  The first request to this endpoint returns a `202 Accepted` status and starts an asynchronous background task to get the results for the domain. After the background task completes, subsequent requests to this endpoint return a `200 OK` status with the health check results in the response.

  The authenticated user must be a repository administrator, maintainer, or have the 'manage GitHub Pages settings' permission to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
