Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

We noticed your personal access token, <%= @oauth_access.description %>, has an outdated format and was used to access the GitHub API on <%= @time %><%= unless @user_agent.blank?; " with a user-agent header of #{@user_agent}"; end %>.

In order to provide additional security benefits to all our customers, we recently updated the format of our API authentication tokens. Please regenerate your personal access tokens to take advantage of these benefits by visiting https://github.com/settings/tokens/.

To understand more about this change and why it's important, visit <%= "#{GitHub.blog_url}/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats" %>.

We encourage you to reset your other authentication tokens as well, or revoke any that are no longer needed. This applies to integrations (such as OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps) as well as personal access tokens. For more information on reviewing your authorized integrations, refer to https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations/.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
