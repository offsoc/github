Hi <%= @inviter.name %>,

This is a friendly reminder that you have not yet confirmed the invitation for <%= @organization.name %> to join the <%= @business.name %> enterprise on GitHub.

To complete the transfer of ownership to <%= @business.name %>, follow this link:

<%= settings_org_billing_url(@business, @organization) %>

If not confirmed, the invitation will expire in <%= @until_expiry_in_words %>.

Some helpful tips:

- If you get a 404 page, make sure youâ€™re signed in as an owner of <%= @business.name %>.
- You can also confirm the invitation by visiting the enterprise page directly at <%= enterprise_url @business %> and clicking the "Pending" button.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
