# Building a custom FilterProvider

## Overview

While we provide a number of common FilterProviders to utilize, there are cases where either the filter is usage-specific or we haven't yet created it. In those cases, this documentation should help walk you through creating your own.

## Fields

Many of the follow fields are specified as parameters to the constructor. However, if it will always be the same, they can be hard coded into the class itself.

* `key: string` - The first part of the FilterBlock, such as `assignees`, `state`, etc.
* `displayName?: string` - An optional field for formatted displays, such as the Advanced Filter Dialog or Suggestions List. This is usually a capitalized value
* `description?: string` - An optional field to describe what this filter is for. Should be a short sentence.
* `priority: number` - A numeric from 1 to 10 priority compared with other filters. Note: Any value above 5 will not be shown in the suggestions list.
* `icon: Icon` - An Octicon icon that shows in lists with the `displayName` to make the filter identifiable
* `options?: FilterProviderOptions` - An `FilterProviderOptions` object specifying what filter types are allowed (`inclusive`, `exclusive`, etc.) as well as `ProviderSupportStatus` (`unsupported`, `supported`, `deprecated`)
* `type: FilterProviderType` - Specifies the type of filter from the `FilterProviderType` list, such as `Select`, `User`, `Date`, etc.
* `filterValues?: FilterValueData[]` - An optional list of fixed or static values. If your Filter Provider requires fetching from the server based on user input, you should not use this field.

## Functions

### `getSuggestions`

This function takes a filter block and computes suggestions to provide the user with, if any.

#### Parameters

* `filterBlock: AnyBlock | MutableFilterBlock` - The filter block to use to compute suggestions with. You can use the `value` to filter down suggestions. Note: `value` could hold multiple values.
* `config: FilterConfig` - The configuration of the Filter component, including any settings or flags that are set.
* `caretIndex?: number | null` - Where the caret is. Using this, you can determine which value (if there are multiple) needs suggestions

#### Returns

* `Promise<FilterSuggestion[] | null> | FilterSuggestion[] | null` - Should return an array of suggestions or null if none found. Note: If your function requires fetching from the server, it should be an async function that returns a promise.

### `validateFilterValue`

This function is meant to take in a single string value to validate.

#### Parameters

* `values: IndexedBlockValueItem[]` - An array of all block values that should be validated
* `config?: FilterConfig` - The configuration object for the filter that may be needed for validation

#### Returns

* `IndexedBlockValueItem | Promise<IndexedBlockValueItem>` - Returns a fully qualified `IndexedBlockValueItem`, including setting its validity. Note: If your function requires fetching from the server, it should be an async function that returns a promise.

### `getValueRowProps`

This function allows for customization for how results show in select fields and lists

#### Parameters

* `value: FilterValueData` - The value data object that will be mapped to the `ValueRowProps`. This has fields like `name`, `icon`, etc.

#### Returns

* `ValueRowProps` - The structured object that is consumed by select fields and lists for displaying of items
