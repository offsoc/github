summary: Delete a file
description: |-
  Deletes a file in a repository.

  You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the author.

  The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.

  You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file contents](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.
