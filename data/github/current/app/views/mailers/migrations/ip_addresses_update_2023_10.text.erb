We're making changes to GitHub Enterprise Importer's IP addresses

We're making changes to the IP addresses used by GitHub Enterprise Importer for outbound network connections.

You will need to add our new IP range, 20.125.12.8/29, to the following IP allow lists, if enabled:

- The IP allow list on your destination GitHub.com organization or enterprise
- If you're running migrations from GitHub.com, the IP allow list on your source GitHub.com organization or enterprise
- If you're running migrations from GitHub Enterprise Server, Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center, the allow list on your configured Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3 storage account
- If you're running migrations from Azure DevOps, the allow list on your Azure DevOps organization

For a full list of our IP ranges and more information, see "Configuring IP allow lists for migrations" in the GitHub Docs (https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/preparing-to-migrate-with-github-enterprise-importer/managing-access-for-github-enterprise-importer#configuring-ip-allow-lists-for-migrations).

This change will take affect at 00:00 UTC on November 8, 2023. If you don't update your IP allow lists by this date, migrations may stop working.

If you don't use IP allow lists or if you're not planning to run more migrations with GitHub Enterprise Importer, you can ignore this message.

You're receiving this email because you have run at least one migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer in the last 90 days.
