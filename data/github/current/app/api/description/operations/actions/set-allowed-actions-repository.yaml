      Sets the actions that are allowed in a repository. To use this endpoint, the repository permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions for a repository](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-a-repository)."

      If the repository belongs to an organization or enterprise that has `selected` actions set at the organization or enterprise levels, then you cannot override any of the allowed actions settings.

      To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the repository must belong to an enterprise. If the repository does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories.

      OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
