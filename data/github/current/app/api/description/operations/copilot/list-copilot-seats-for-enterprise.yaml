  > [!NOTE]
  > This endpoint is in beta and is subject to change.

  Lists all active Copilot seats across organizations or enterprise teams for an enterprise with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscription.

  Users with access through multiple organizations or enterprise teams will only be counted toward `total_seats` once.

  For each organization or enterprise team which grants Copilot access to a user, a seat detail object will appear in the `seats` array.

  Only enterprise owners and billing managers can view assigned Copilot seats across their child organizations or enterprise teams.

  Personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot` or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.
