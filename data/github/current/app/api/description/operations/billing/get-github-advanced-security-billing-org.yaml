summary: Get GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an organization
description: |-
  Gets the GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an organization per repository.

  Each distinct user login across all repositories is counted as a single Advanced Security seat, so the `total_advanced_security_committers` is not the sum of advanced_security_committers for each repository.

  If this organization defers to an enterprise for billing, the `total_advanced_security_committers` returned from the organization API may include some users that are in more than one organization, so they will only consume a single Advanced Security seat at the enterprise level.

  The total number of repositories with committer information is tracked by the `total_count` field.
