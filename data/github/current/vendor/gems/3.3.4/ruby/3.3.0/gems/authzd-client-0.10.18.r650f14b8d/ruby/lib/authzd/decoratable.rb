    # Wraps the original method into an object that has the middleware spec
    # of responding to .perform.
    #
    class Adapter
      def initialize(receiver, method)
        @receiver = receiver
        @method   = method

        @receiver.send(@method, *args)
      end
    end


    # Decorators can be used to augment the client methods with custom features.
    # A middleware is object that has a `:request` accessor and can forward the
    # execution of `perform` to it. The following is an example of a middleware
    # implementing a read-through cache:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # class Cache
    #   attr_accessor :request
    #
    #   def initialize(cache, ttl)
    #     @cache = cache
    #     @ttl = ttl
    #   end
    #
    #   def perform(*args)
    #     @cache.fetch("authzd:client:v1:#{args.hash}", ttl: @ttl) do
    #       self.request.perform(*args)
    #     end
    #   end
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # You can use it to decorate a method in the Client, with a single middleware:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # authorizer = Authzd::Authorizer::Client.new(SERVER_ADDRESS, timeout: TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS) do |client|
    #   client.decorate :authorize, with: Cache.new(App.cache, App.config.ttl)
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # Or with a stack of method_middleware that are applied from the left (outermost middleware)
    # to the right (innermost middleware)
    #
    # ```ruby
    # authorizer = Authzd::Authorizer::Client.new(SERVER_ADDRESS, timeout: TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS) do |client|
    #   client.decorate :authorize, with: [logging, instrumentation, caching]
    # end
    # ```
    # Internally this method, will transform the singleton class (aka eigenclass)
    # of the receiver object converting every decorated method
    # Imagine the following class:
    #
    # class MyClass
    #   def hello(name)
    #     puts "hello #{name}"
    #   end
    #
    #   def self.decoratable_methods
    #     [:foo]
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # When the Decoratable module is included, the class will in memory be transformed
    # into something like this:
    #
    # class MyClass
    #
    #   def original_hello(name)
    #     puts "hello #{name}"
    #   end
    #
    #   def hello(*args)
    #     decorated(:hello).perform(*args)
    #   end
    #
    #   ... Rest of the methods of Decoratable
    # end
    #
    # And `decorated(:hello)`, whill generate an object responding to `:perform`
    # that has all the method_middleware properly composed, and terminated by a wrapper
    # of the original method.
    #
    # In the previous example:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # authorizer = Authzd::Authorizer::Client.new(SERVER_ADDRESS, timeout: TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS) do |client|
    #   client.decorate :authorize, with: [logging, instrumentation, caching]
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # when we call `authorizer.authorize Request.new` the following set of calls
    # will happen
    #
    # authorizer.authorize(kwargs)
    #  logging logic before decoration
    #  logging.request.perform(kwargs)
    #    instrumentation logic before decoration
    #    instrumentation.request.perform(kwargs)
    #      caching logic before decoration
    #      caching.request.perform(kwargs)
    #        anonymous_object.perform(kwargs)
    #           authorizer.send :original_authorize, kwargs
    #      caching logic after decoration
    #     instrumentation logic after decoration
    #   logging loggic after decoration
    # return result value
    #
