description: |-
  Lists code scanning alerts for the default branch for all eligible repositories in an enterprise. Eligible repositories are repositories that are owned by organizations that you own or for which you are a security manager. For more information, see "[Managing security managers in your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization)."

  The authenticated user must be a member of the enterprise to use this endpoint.
