summary: Search commits
description: |-
  Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usually `main`). This method returns up to 100 results [per page](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).

  When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match
  metadata](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).

  For example, if you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look something like this:

  `q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css`
tags:
  - search
operationId: search/commits
externalDocs:
  description: API method documentation
  url: '${externalDocsUrl}/rest/search/search#search-commits'
parameters:
  - name: q
    description: The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers
      allow you to limit your search to specific areas of ${apiName}. The REST API supports
      the same qualifiers as the web interface for ${apiName}. To learn more about the format of the query,
      see [Constructing a search query](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/search/search#constructing-a-search-query).
      See "[Searching commits](${externalDocsUrl}/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-commits)"
      for a detailed list of qualifiers.
