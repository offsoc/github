              **Deprecated**: The list of status checks to require in order to
              merge into this branch. If any of these checks have recently been
              set by a particular GitHub App, they will be required to come from
              that app in future for the branch to merge.
              Use `checks` instead of `contexts` for more fine-grained control.
