summary: Disable a workflow
description: |-
  Disables a workflow and sets the `state` of the workflow to `disabled_manually`. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
