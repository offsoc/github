  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a pull request review. A pull request review is a group of pull request review comments in addition to a body comment and a state. For more information, see "[About pull request reviews](${externalDocsUrl}/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)." For information about the APIs to manage pull request reviews, see [the GraphQL API documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#pullrequestreview) or "[Pull request reviews](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/pulls/reviews)" in the REST API documentation.

  For activity related to pull request review comments, pull request comments, or pull request review threads, use the `pull_request_review_comment`, `issue_comment`, or `pull_request_review_thread` events instead.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Pull requests" repository permission.
