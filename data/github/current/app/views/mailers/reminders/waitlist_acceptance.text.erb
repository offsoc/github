# Welcome to scheduled reminders

Your organization, <%= @membership.member.name %> is off the waitlist—you're all set to add reminders for important pull requests!

Create scheduled reminders at <%= org_reminders_url(@membership.member) %>

## How to get started

There are a few steps we’ll take you through to authorize workspaces and create scheduled reminders on GitHub.

  1.  Make sure you're signed in as an admin of your organization
  2.  Follow the instructions in our set-up flow to authorize Slack workspaces
  3.  Choose times and channels for your team’s scheduled reminders

Once reminders are set up for your organization, team members can also set up personal scheduled reminders in their settings to receive Slack direct messages for pull requests assigned to them. <%= personal_reminders_url %>
