# Getting Started

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation and for easily sharing visuals and behaviors. We host a [production Storybook](https://gh.io/storybook) and provide [PR previews](https://github.com/github/engineering/discussions/2975) that can be shared with teammates across our EPD functions. We distinguish between four [different categories](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs#categories) of components to keep things organized and to make it easier to find what you are looking for. For further information on building and deploying your recipe follow the [Recipes Framework on the Hub](https://thehub.github.com/epd/design-system/recipes/).

## Developing Recipes with Storybook

Start by opening [**github/github**](https://github.com/github/github) in a codespace, then run:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build a new component run:

```shell
scaffold-ui-package
```

## Writing Accessible UI at GitHub

[Accessibility is fundamental](https://thehub.github.com/epd/engineering/fundamentals/#accessibility-pillar) at GitHub. Storybook provides integrated tooling to automate detection of [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) violations in our UI components. In development, the accessibility panel will highlight violations. Additionally, all Storybook stories are automatically scanned in a [GitHub action](https://github.com/github/github/actions/workflows/storybook-axe.yml). For guidance or manual audits please reach out to the Accessibility team early in the process.

## Components

Any component developed should follow the criteria to be accessible, consistent with the design system and reusable. That way, everyone benefits and we can avoid duplicating work. Primer has created a framework to help you develop components that meet these criteria. You can find more information about the Recipes Framework on [The Hub](https://thehub.github.com/epd/design-system/recipes/).

### Categories

There are currently four categories that you can list your component in:

* `Recipes` are compositions of components with accessibility and reusability in mind.
* `Utilities` offer functionalities without a direct user interface.
* `Apps` are comprehensive solutions encapsulated as standalone applications.
* `Templates` are simple boilerplates ready to copy paste.
* Everything else will be listed in `Others`.

### States

Stages of the component development process

* <span className="f6 IssueLabel d-inline-flex flex-align-center text-bold color-bg-subtle color-fg-muted color-border-subtle">Draft</span> - The component is in [planning](https://thehub.github.com/epd/design-system/recipes/?reloaded=true#1-planning) or in [development](https://thehub.github.com/epd/design-system/recipes/?reloaded=true#2-development) but has not been audited yet.
* <span className="f6 IssueLabel d-inline-flex flex-align-center text-bold color-bg-accent color-fg-accent color-border-accent-emphasis">In Review</span> - The component is undergoing an [ accessibility audit](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/audit/process.md).
* <span className="f6 IssueLabel d-inline-flex flex-align-center text-bold color-bg-success color-fg-success color-border-success-emphasis">Ready</span> - Once all audit issues have been closed, the component is ready to be adopted by other teams.

## Ownership

Your team takes on the ownership and maintenance responsibilities for your components. If at any point your team is unable to continue supporting it, it's your responsibility to identify and coordinate with another team who can take over its upkeep.

## Questions or Feedback?

We would love to hear feedback from you. If you have questions about Storybook, reach out in [#web-systems](https://github.slack.com/archives/CMZ4DC9BL). If you have component specific questions, reach out in [#primer](https://github.slack.com/archives/CSGAVNZ19) on Slack.
