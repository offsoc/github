Hi there!

This is a note to let you know that <% if @team_destroyed %>the "<%= @org.safe_profile_name %>" organization’s Owners team has been deleted<% else %>you’ve been removed from the Owners team on the "<%= @org.safe_profile_name %>" organization<% end %>.

Don’t worry! You’re still an owner of the organization:

<%= @org.safe_profile_name %>

With GitHub’s new organization permissions model, the Owners team no longer grants administrative privileges, and organization members can now:

- Create repositories and teams.
- See and @ mention all teams.
- See all members of the organization.

These changes help organizations reduce the number of owners, which improves security. Read more about the new permissions at <%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization
