summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a merge group in a merge queue. For more information, see "[Managing a merge queue](${externalDocsUrl}/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue)."

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Merge queues" repository permission.
description: |-
  The merge queue groups pull requests together to be merged. This event indicates that one of those merge groups was destroyed. This happens when a pull request is removed from the queue: any group containing that pull request is also destroyed.

  When you receive this event, you may want to cancel any checks that are running on the head SHA to avoid wasting computing resources on a merge group that will not be used.
