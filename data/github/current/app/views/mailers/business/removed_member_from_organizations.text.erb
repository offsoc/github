<% if @user.present? %>
Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

<% end %>
You’ve been removed from <%= pluralize(@orgs_count, "organization") %> in the <%= @business.name %> enterprise because you don’t have two-factor authentication on your user account. The <%= @business.name %> enterprise requires all of its organization members to have two-factor authentication enabled.

What happens after that?

After you’ve enabled two-factor authentication, contact a member of each of your organizations to let them know you want your access restored.

Organizations you have been removed from:

<%= @organizations.map { |org| "#{org.safe_profile_name} (@#{org.display_login})" }.join("\n") %>


Only a person with owner permissions in each organization can restore your membership and previous privileges directly. If the person you contact isn’t an organization owner, they can look up an organization owner (<%= @lookup_org_owner_help_doc_url %>) and forward your request to them.

Visit <%= settings_security_url %> to enable two-factor authentication on your account.
