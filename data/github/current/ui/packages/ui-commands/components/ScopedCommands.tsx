  // with DOM handlers so we can 'get to them first'. However, this is not good enough because with scoped commands we
  // want the user to be able to fire commands when their focus is inside a menu overlay. This only works with React

  // contents in an element inherently introduces potential style and layout breaks. The only way to avoid that is
  // with `display: contents`; otherwise consumers will have to deal with fixing everything that this breaks every time
  // they use this component and they will be discouraged from adopting the new platform.
  // If `as` is set to something other than `div`, we don't do this, because we assume the consumer is now thinking
