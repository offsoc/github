Hi <%= @actor.name %>,

Your enterprise account, <%= @business.slug %>, has been successfully created, but your <%= @organization.safe_profile_name %> organization has not yet been upgraded.
The required number of seats may have changed before your purchase was processed.

To complete the upgrade:
The <%= @business.slug %> enterprise needs <%= @additional_seats_needed %> additional <%= "seat".pluralize(@additional_seats_needed) %> to add <%= @organization.safe_profile_name %>
<%= enterprise_licensing_url(@business, manage_seats: true) %>

Then, head over to organization invitations at <%= new_enterprise_organization_invitation_url(@business) %> to invite <%= @organization.safe_profile_name %> to your new enterprise account.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
