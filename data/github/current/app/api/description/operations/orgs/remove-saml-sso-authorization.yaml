summary: Remove a SAML SSO authorization for an organization
description: |-
  Removes a credential authorization for an organization that uses SAML SSO. Once you remove someone's credential authorization, they will need to create a new personal access token or SSH key and authorize it for the organization they want to access.

  The authenticated user must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
