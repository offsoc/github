You're just a couple of steps away from publishing your sponsorship page.

### Step 1: Complete the signup process

Please complete the required steps to publish your GitHub Sponsors profile.

<%= @signup_url %>

### Step 2: Get your profile approved

Once you complete your GitHub Sponsors profile, submit it for identity verification
and approval by GitHub staff. We'll follow up by email when your profile has been approved.

<% if @listing.matchable? %>
You may be eligible for the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund (https://docs.github.com/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund). We will review your profile for eligibility once you submit it. You have two months to submit your profile for approval before your twelve-month matching period starts. Submit your profile soon to make sure you can take advantage of the full matching period!

Once the matching period starts, you can still submit your profile for approval. Once your profile is approved, you'll be eligible for matching for the remainder of the matching period.
<% end %>

### Step 3: Get paid

<% if @is_user && @listing.joined_waitlist_before_match_deadline? %>
  You'll be eligible for payment around <%= SponsorsListing::PAYOUT_PROBATION_DAYS %> days after the first person sponsors you.
<% else %>
  Once you receive your first sponsorship, you will be paid around the <%= SponsorsListing::MONTHLY_PAYOUT_DAY.ordinalize %> of each month!
<% end %>

And that's it! Thank you for your contribution to open source â€” we're excited to see
all the ways GitHub Sponsors can support you.
