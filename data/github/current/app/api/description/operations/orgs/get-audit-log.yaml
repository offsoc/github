description: |-
  Gets the audit log for an organization. For more information, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

  By default, the response includes up to 30 events from the past three months. Use the `phrase` parameter to filter results and retrieve older events. For example, use the `phrase` parameter with the `created` qualifier to filter events based on when the events occurred. For more information, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#searching-the-audit-log)."

  Use pagination to retrieve fewer or more than 30 events. For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

  This endpoint has a rate limit of 1,750 queries per hour per user and IP address.  If your integration receives a rate limit error (typically a 403 or 429 response), it should wait before making another request to the GitHub API. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the REST API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api)" and "[Best practices for integrators](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators)."

  The authenticated user must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:audit_log` scope to use this endpoint.
