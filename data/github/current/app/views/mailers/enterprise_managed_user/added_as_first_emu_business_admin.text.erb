Hi <%= @user.safe_profile_name %>,

You’ve been added as <%= @role_for_email %> of the <%= @business.name %> enterprise on GitHub. Head over to <%= @password_reset_link %> to set your password and begin configuring your enterprise account <%= @business.name %>.

This link will expire in <%= pluralize(@expires, "day") %>.

<% if GitHub.flipper[:resend_initial_first_emu_admin_password_reset].enabled? %>
If the link has expired, <%= link_to "click here to generate a new password reset link", "#{@password_reset_url}" %>.
<% end %>

<% if @business.seats_plan_basic? %>
Once your password is set, you can return to <%= @enterprise_url %> to configure your enterprise account any time using the instructions in this documentation:

<%= "#{GitHub.help_url}/early-access/copilot/managing-copilot-business-licenses-with-an-enterprise-account" %>
<% else %>
Once your password is set, you can return to <%= @enterprise_url %> to configure your enterprise account any time.
<% end %>

You’re receiving this email because you were added as <%= @role_for_email %> of an enterprise on GitHub

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
