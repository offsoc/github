Ending support for the Source Imports REST API

You're receiving this email because one of your personal access tokens or apps has used the Source Imports REST API (https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports) in the last 90 days.

We're ending support for this API on April 12, 2024 due to very low levels of usage and the alternatives available.

It will no longer be available from 00:00 UTC on April 12, 2024. From this date onwards, any requests to this API will receive an error response.

We know that changes like this have a big impact, and we're sorry for any inconvenience caused.

To give you time to adapt, we're giving 6 months' notice about this change. We've published a new article on the GitHub Docs, "Programatically importing repositories" (https://docs.github.com/migrations/overview/programmatically-importing-repositories), explaining how you can replace this API in your application.

If you have any questions about this change, please reach out to GitHub Support at https://support.github.com, and we'll be happy to help.
