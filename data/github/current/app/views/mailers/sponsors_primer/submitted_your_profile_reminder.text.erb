Hi <%= @sponsorable.name %>!

  You may be eligible for the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund <https://docs.github.com/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund>. We will review your profile for eligibility once you submit it. You have two months to submit your profile for approval before your twelve-month matching period starts. Submit your profile soon to make sure you can take advantage of the full matching period!

  Once the matching period starts, you can still submit your profile for approval. Once your profile is approved, you'll be eligible for matching for the remainder of the matching period.
