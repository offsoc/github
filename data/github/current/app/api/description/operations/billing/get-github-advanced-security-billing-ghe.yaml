summary: Get GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an enterprise
description: |-
  Gets the GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an enterprise per repository.

  Each distinct user login across all repositories is counted as a single Advanced Security seat, so the `total_advanced_security_committers` is not the sum of active_users for each repository.

  The total number of repositories with committer information is tracked by the `total_count` field.
