  The following fields on an organization are deprecated and will be removed in the next REST API version:

  * `advanced_security_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `dependabot_alerts_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `dependabot_security_updates_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `dependency_graph_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `secret_scanning_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `secret_scanning_push_protection_enabled_for_new_repositories`
  * `secret_scanning_validity_checks_enabled`

  Values set for these fields will no longer affect enablement of code security products for new repositories.

  Code security product enablement for new repositories can now be managed using [code security configurations](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/code-security/configurations).
