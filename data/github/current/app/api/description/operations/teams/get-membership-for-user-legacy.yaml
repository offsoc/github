summary: Get team membership for a user (Legacy)
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Get team membership for a user](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/members#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.

  Team members will include the members of child teams.

  To get a user's membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.

  **Note:**
  The response contains the `state` of the membership and the member's `role`.

  The `role` for organization owners is set to `maintainer`. For more information about `maintainer` roles, see [Create a team](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/teams#create-a-team).
