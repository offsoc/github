summary: Get repository permissions for a user
description: |-
  Checks the repository permission of a collaborator. The possible repository
  permissions are `admin`, `write`, `read`, and `none`.

  *Note*: The `permission` attribute provides the legacy base roles of `admin`, `write`, `read`, and `none`, where the
  `maintain` role is mapped to `write` and the `triage` role is mapped to `read`. To determine the role assigned to the
  collaborator, see the `role_name` attribute, which will provide the full role name, including custom roles. The
  `permissions` hash can also be used to determine which base level of access the collaborator has to the repository.
