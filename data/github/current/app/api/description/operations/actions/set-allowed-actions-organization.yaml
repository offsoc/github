    summary: Set allowed actions for an organization
    description: |-
      Sets the actions that are allowed in an organization. To use this endpoint, the organization permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions for an organization](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-an-organization)."

      If the organization belongs to an enterprise that has `selected` actions set at the enterprise level, then you cannot override any of the enterprise's allowed actions settings.

      To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the organization must belong to an enterprise. If the organization does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories in the organization.

      OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
