summary: 'Get Copilot usage metrics for an organization'
description: |-
  TODO: endpoint/aggregation description

  > [!NOTE]
  > This endpoint will only return results for a given day if the organization contained **five or more members with active Copilot licenses**, as evaluated at the end of that day.

  The response contains metrics for up to 28 days prior. Metrics are processed once per day for the previous day,
  and the response will only include data up until yesterday. In order for an end user to be counted towards these metrics,
  they must have telemetry enabled in their IDE.

  Organization owners, and owners and billing managers of the parent enterprise, can view Copilot usage metrics.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:org`, or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.
