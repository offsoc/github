summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to an organization and its members. For more information, see "[About organizations](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)." For information about the APIs to manage organizations, see [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#organization) or "[Organizations](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.

  If you want to receive an event when a non-member is blocked or unblocked from an organization, use the `org_block` event instead.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Members" organization permission.
