<%#
Show inline comment threads on split diffs.

  - A comment thread has a reply form
  - At the end of the thread itself, a "new conversation" form appears

Comments on split diffs can appear in three places:

  - Context lines around the diff lines (ie. lines that have not changed, neither added nor removed lines)
  - Left threads
  - Right threads

This partial is also used to display split diff *commit* comment threads.
