summary: Update a gist
description: |-
  Allows you to update a gist's description and to update, delete, or rename gist files. Files
  from the previous version of the gist that aren't explicitly changed during an edit
  are unchanged.

  At least one of `description` or `files` is required.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.base64+json`**: Returns the base64-encoded contents. This can be useful if your gist contains any invalid UTF-8 sequences.

          files:
            description: |-
              The gist files to be updated, renamed, or deleted. Each `key` must match the current filename
              (including extension) of the targeted gist file. For example: `hello.py`.

              To delete a file, set the whole file to null. For example: `hello.py : null`. The file will also be
              deleted if the specified object does not contain at least one of `content` or `filename`.
            example:
              hello.rb:
                content: blah
                filename: goodbye.rb
