    You’ve been removed as a collaborator on <%= org_name %>’s repositories
    because you don’t have two-factor authentication on your user account. The
    <%= org_name %> organization requires all affiliated users to have
    two-factor authentication enabled.

    <strong>What happens after that?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    After you’ve enabled two-factor authentication, contact a member of your
    organization to let them know you want your access restored. Only a person
    with owner permissions in your organization can restore your
    previous privileges directly. If the person you contact isn’t an
    organization owner, <a href="<%= @lookup_org_owner_help_doc_url %>">they can
    look up an organization owner</a> and forward your request to them.
