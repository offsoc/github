summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to milestones. For more information, see "[About milestones](${externalDocsUrl}/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)." For information about the APIs to manage milestones, see [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#milestone) or "[Milestones](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/issues/milestones)" in the REST API documentation.

  If you want to receive an event when an issue or pull request is added to or removed from a milestone, use the `milestoned` or `demilestoned` action type for the `issues` or `pull_request` events instead.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Issues" or "Pull requests" repository permissions.
