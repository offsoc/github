[COMMUNITY_NAME] is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all [COMMUNITY_NAME] spaces, including [LIST_OF_SPACES - e.g. "our mailing lists and IRC channel"], both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the [RESPONSE_TEAM].

Some [COMMUNITY_NAME] spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
