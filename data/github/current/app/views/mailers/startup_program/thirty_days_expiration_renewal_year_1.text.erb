Thank you for being a part of GitHub for Startups!

We're reaching out because your program expiration is coming up on <%= @expiration_date %>.

Want to continue on GitHub Enterprise? We're offering startups associated with an approved GitHub for Startups partner

GitHub Enterprise features (https://github.com/pricing/) you'd lose:
- 50K Action mins per month
- User Management (SSO)
- Organizational Controls (SOC)
... and exclusive events, office hours, and webinars!

To ensure your Enterprise plan is not interrupted, please notify us with your intent to continue on GitHub Enterprise at
least 5 business days before your program expiration so we can send over a quote and next steps.

Interested in GitHub Advanced Security? We're also inviting startups returning to the program and new to Advanced security
a 50% discount on GitHub Advanced Security! Let us know if you're interested in learning more about
Code Scanning (https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning),

If we don't hear from you, your organization will automatically be downgraded to a Free plan on your termination date,
and your Enterprise Account will be deleted. You will be notified once your organization has been removed from the Enterprise,
at which time you may self-serve upgrade to the Team tier.
