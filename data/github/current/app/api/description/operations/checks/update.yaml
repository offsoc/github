summary: Update a check run
description: |-
  Updates a check run for a specific commit in a repository.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.

  OAuth apps and personal access tokens (classic) cannot use this endpoint.

                  are visible in GitHub's pull request UI. The Checks API limits the
                  number of annotations to a maximum of 50 per API request. To create
                  more than 50 annotations, you have to make multiple requests to
                  the [Update a check run](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/checks/runs#update-a-check-run)
                  endpoint. Each time you update the check run, annotations are appended
                  to the list of annotations that already exist for the check run. GitHub
                  Actions are limited to 10 warning annotations and 10 error annotations per step.
                  For details about annotations in the UI, see "[About status checks](${externalDocsUrl}/articles/about-status-checks#checks)".
