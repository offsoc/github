<%# workaround for browser password autofill. Browsers will try to autofill %>
<%# username and password on any page that has an input type="password". This %>
<%# works around that by adding dummy password and text fields to the form. %>
<%# To use this, drop this partial at the top of your form, before any other inputs  %>
<input type="text" style="display:none">
<input type="password" style="display:none">
