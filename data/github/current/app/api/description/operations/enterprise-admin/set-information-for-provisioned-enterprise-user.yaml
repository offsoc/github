summary: Set SCIM information for a provisioned enterprise user
description: |-
  > [!NOTE]
  > The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently in *private* beta and are subject to change.

  Replaces an existing provisioned user's information.

  You must provide all the information required for the user as if you were provisioning them for the first time. Any existing user information that you don't provide will be removed. If you want to only update a specific attribute, use the [Update an attribute for a SCIM user](#update-an-attribute-for-a-scim-enterprise-user) endpoint instead.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Setting `active: false` will suspend a user and obfuscate the user handle and user email. Since the implementation is a generic SCIM implementation and does not differentiate yet between different IdP providers, for Okta, the user GDPR data will not be purged and the credentials will not be removed.

      Replaces an existing provisioned user's information.

      You must supply complete user information, just as you would when provisioning them initially. Any previously existing data not provided will be deleted. To update only a specific attribute, refer to the [Update an attribute for a SCIM user](#update-an-attribute-for-a-scim-enterprise-user) endpoint.

      > [!WARNING]
      > Setting `active: false` will suspend a user, and their handle and email will be obfuscated.
