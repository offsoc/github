Hello,

We're following up as your access to GitHub for Startups expires in 3 days.

Please let us know if you'd like to continue on GitHub Enterprise so we can send over next steps.

If not, no worries. Once your termination is processed, you'll be notified when your organization(s) are removed from your Enterprise Account and downgraded to a Free plan.
Once that takes place, you'll have the ability to remain on the free tier or self-serve purchase the Team plan. If you receive an invoice for any consumptive add-ons, you will still be able to pay in the admin dashboard.

Thanks again for having been a part of GitHub for Startups!

Regards,

The GitHub for Startups Team
