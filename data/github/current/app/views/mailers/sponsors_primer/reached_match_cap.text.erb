Hi @<%= @sponsorable_login %>,

Congratulations, you just crossed the <%= @match_limit %> threshold in contributions! Once you count the additional match from the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund, that's <%= @sponsorships_plus_match %> of funding for your wonderful open source work. ðŸŽ‰

Now that you've hit <%= @match_limit %> matched, GitHub will no longer match your sponsorships moving forward.

We're amazed by the community you've built and are so proud to play a small role in accelerating your open source work. Thank you for your open source contributions and for being an early user of GitHub Sponsors.
