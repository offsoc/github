Unused public IPs will be deleted in 3 days

We are notifying you as an admin of <%= @setting_link_content[:text] %> that we've detected Actions runners with unused public IP ranges.
The public IP range for some of your runners have not been used in over <%= @expiration_days%> days. Per our fair usage policy <%= GitHub.help_url %>/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-larger-runners#networking-for-larger-runners it will be deleted in 3 days.
You can recover these IP ranges by re-enabling them in the runners UI and then running at least one workflow on these runners.

Below is the list of runners using fixed IP ranges. You can find these runners under your <%= @setting_link_content[:text] %> settings:

<%= @setting_link_content[:link] %>

<% @runner_names.each do |name| %>
- <%= name %>
<% end %>
