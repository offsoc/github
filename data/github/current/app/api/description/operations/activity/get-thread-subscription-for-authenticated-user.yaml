summary: Get a thread subscription for the authenticated user
description: |-
  This checks to see if the current user is subscribed to a thread. You can also [get a repository subscription](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/activity/watching#get-a-repository-subscription).

  Note that subscriptions are only generated if a user is participating in a conversation--for example, they've replied to the thread, were **@mentioned**, or manually subscribe to a thread.
