Upgrade to continue using GitHub Actions Public IP Ranges

Your organization <%= @account.name %> no longer has access to an Enterprise plan, as part of this you no longer have access to the Public IP feature for GitHub-hosted runners.

You can recover these IP ranges if you upgrade back to an Enterprise plan, otherwise they will be permanently deleted in 3 days.

Upgrade <%= @account.name %> Plan: <%= @upgrade_link %>

Below is a list of the runners which were using fixed IP ranges:

<% @affected_pools.each do |name| %>
  <%= name %>
<% end %>

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
