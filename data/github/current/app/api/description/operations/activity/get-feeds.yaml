summary: Get feeds
description: |-
  Lists the feeds available to the authenticated user. The response provides a URL for each feed. You can then get a specific feed by sending a request to one of the feed URLs.

  *   **Timeline**: The ${apiName} global public timeline
  *   **User**: The public timeline for any user, using `uri_template`. For more information, see "[Hypermedia](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia)."
  *   **Current user public**: The public timeline for the authenticated user
  *   **Current user**: The private timeline for the authenticated user
  *   **Current user actor**: The private timeline for activity created by the authenticated user
  *   **Current user organizations**: The private timeline for the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.
  *   **Security advisories**: A collection of public announcements that provide information about security-related vulnerabilities in software on ${apiName}.

  By default, timeline resources are returned in JSON. You can specify the `application/atom+xml` type in the `Accept` header to return timeline resources in Atom format. For more information, see "[Media types](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  > [!NOTE]
  > Private feeds are only returned when [authenticating via Basic Auth](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api#using-basic-authentication) since current feed URIs use the older, non revocable auth tokens.
