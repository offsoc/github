  The `inactive` state and the `log_url`, `environment_url`, and `auto_inactive` parameters are currently available for developers to preview. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-04-06-deployment-and-deployment-status-enhancements) for full details.

  To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.ant-man-preview+json
  ```
