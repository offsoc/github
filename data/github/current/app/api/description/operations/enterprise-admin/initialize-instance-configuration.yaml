summary: Initialize instance configuration with license upload
description: |-
  When you boot a GitHub instance for the first time, you can use this endpoint to upload a license.

  Note that you afterwards need to `POST` to [`/manage/v1/config/apply`](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes#start-configuration-apply-process) to start the actual configuration process.

  This endpoint also sets the root site administrator password which is used to authenticate with the GHES Manage API and the Management Console.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The request body for this operation must be submitted as `multipart/form-data` data. You can can reference the license file by prefixing the filename with the `@` symbol using `curl`. For more information, see the [`curl` documentation](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-F).
