# Migrating your licensed configuration and cached records to licensed v2

Licensed v2+ ships with an additional executable, `licensed-migrator`, that can be used to update your licensed files to the format expected by the currently installed version.  To run, execute `licensed migrate --from v1 -c <path to licensed configuration file>`, replacing `v1` with the major version of licensed to migrate from.
