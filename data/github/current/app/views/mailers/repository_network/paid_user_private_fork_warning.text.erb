Dear <%= @user %>,

During recent maintenance we discovered that your private fork <%= @nwo %>’s parent repository <%= @parent_nwo %> is public. We no longer allow the creation of private forks from public repositories, so we need to make some changes to your fork.

To protect your code’s privacy we don’t automatically make a fork public to match the parent repository. Instead, <%= @nwo %> will be unforked in three days and become a new private repository under your account.

If you would prefer that <%= @nwo %> remain a fork of <%= @parent_nwo %>, and you are OK with its contents becoming publicly available, within the next three days you can make the fork public from its settings page:

https://github.com/<%= @nwo %>/settings

If you would like to continue using the fork as a private repository, you will need to upgrade your plan or remove an existing private repository to make room under your current plan:

https://github.com/settings/billing

If you don’t take action, in three days <%= @nwo %> will be unforked and locked until you reduce the number of private repositories under your account, upgrade your plan, or make <%= @nwo %> public.

Please reply to this email or <%= GitHub.support_link_text_no_please %> if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jesse
