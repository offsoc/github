Hello!

The <%= @transfer.organization %> organization has been successfully transferred by <% if @transfer.show_actor? %>@<%= @transfer.actor.display_login %><% else %>GitHub staff<% end %> from the <%= @transfer.from_business.name %> enterprise to the <%= @transfer.to_business.name %> enterprise.

The following changes have been made:

- The <%= @transfer.organization %> organization is now part of the <%= @transfer.to_business.name %> enterprise, and is no longer part of the <%= @transfer.from_business.name %> enterprise.
- Billing, identity management, 2FA requirements, and other policies are now governed by the <%= @transfer.to_business.name %> enterprise.

Youâ€™re receiving this email because <%= @transfer.organization %> was transferred from the <%= @transfer.from_business.name %> enterprise to the <%= @transfer.to_business.name %> enterprise on GitHub.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
