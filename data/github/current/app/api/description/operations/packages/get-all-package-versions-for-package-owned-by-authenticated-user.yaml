summary: List package versions for a package owned by the authenticated user
description: |-
  Lists package versions for a package owned by the authenticated user.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
