  The API to get issue timeline events is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the APIs may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-23-timeline-preview-api/) for full details. To access the API you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.mockingbird-preview
  ```
