  Hi <strong><%= @user.safe_profile_name %></strong>!
</p>

<% case @reason %>
<% when :two_factor_requirement_non_compliance %>
  <p>
    You’ve been removed as <%= @role_for_email %> of the <%= @business.name %> enterprise on GitHub
    because you don’t have two-factor authentication on your user account. The
    <%= @business.name %> enterprise requires all members to have two-factor
    authentication enabled.
  </p>

  <%= render(Mail::ContainerComponent.new) do %>
    <%= render(
      Mail::ButtonComponent.new(
        text: "Turn on two-factor authentication",
        url: settings_security_url(via_email: "1"),
        classes: "btn-primary btn-large"
      )
    ) %>
  <% end %>

  <%= render(Mail::SpacerComponent.new) %>

  <p>
    <strong>What happens after that?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    After you’ve enabled two-factor authentication, contact a member of your
    enterprise to let them know you want your access restored. Only a person
    with owner permissions in your enterprise can restore your membership and
    previous privileges directly.
