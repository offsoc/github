WHEREAS, GitHub and Minimum Viable Software have agreed to make certain
targeted changes to the EULA, which are reflected in this Amendment.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1. Expansion of Restricted Uses. Section 3.1 (d) of the EULA will be deemed deleted, and
replaced with the following:

  3.1 You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to)... (d) redistribute the Software as
  part of a product, “appliance” or “virtual server”, except GitHub Enterprise Server;

Section 3.1 (c) of the EULA will be deemed deleted, and replaced with the following:

  3.1 You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to)... (c) redistribute the Software or
  Modifications other than by including the Software or a portion thereof within your own
  product, which must have substantially different functionality than the Software or
  Modifications;

Section 3.1 (i) of the EULA will be deemed deleted, and replaced with the following:

  3.1 You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to)... (i) utilize any equipment,
  device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove any form of Source
  URL or copy protection used by Minimum Viable Software in connection with the
  Software, or use the Software together with any authorization code, Source URL, serial
  number, or other copy protection device not supplied by Minimum Viable Software
  except that the Software may be included in full as part of GitHub Enterprise Server;

2. Counterparts; No Other Modifications. This Amendment may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall be deemed to constitute the Amendment when a duly authorized representative of each
party has signed and delivered to the other party a counterpart. Except as expressly provided
herein, nothing in this Amendment shall be deemed to waive or modify any of the provisions of
the EULA, which otherwise remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between
the EULA and this Amendment, this Amendment shall prevail.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties cause this Amendment to be signed by their duly
authorized representatives as of the Amendment Effective Date.
