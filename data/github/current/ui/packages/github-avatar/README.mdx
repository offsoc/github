# `@github-ui/github-avatar`

> Optimized avatar component that loads smaller images based on the configured size

`@github-ui/github-avatar` is a thin wrapper around [Primer's Avatar component](https://primer.style/react/Avatar) that optimizes the URL of the avatar based on the provided size.

For example

```js
<Avatar src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/mona" size=20 />
```

is loading

![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/mona)

while

```js
<GitHubAvatar src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/mona" size=20 />
```

is loading

![](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/mona?size=40)

which saves about 40kb.
