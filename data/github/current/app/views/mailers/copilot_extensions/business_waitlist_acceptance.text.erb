Introducing GitHub Copilot Extensions: unlocking unlimited possibilities with our ecosystem of technology partners

Dear <%= @user_login %>,

As an administrator of <%= @biz_or_org_name %>, you have been granted access to the GitHub Copilot Extensions limited
public beta. This is a by-invite only beta allowing participants access to Copilot Extensions through supported
extensions from our partners including Docker, Microsoft, Sentry, and more.

The following resources are available to help you get started:

  - Learn more about GitHub Copilot Extensions: <%= Copilot::EXTENSIONS_LEARN_MORE %>
  - Explore Copilot Extensions & install them from the GitHub Marketplace: <%= marketplace_url %>
  - Get started using your first extension with the GitHub Copilot Extensions documentation: <%= Copilot::EXTENSIONS_DOCS %>

As with any beta release: <%= Copilot::BETA_TERMS_OF_SERVICE %>
you will need to enable Copilot Extensions as an organizational policy: <%= Copilot::EXTENSIONS_POLICY_DOCS %>
and install extensions before anyone in your organization or enterprise can use them.

As an early user, you may also encounter some bugs and issues along the way.
Please submit any feedback at our GitHub communities page: <%= Copilot::COPILOT_FEEDBACK_FORUM %>
For more information on setting up and using GitHub Copilot, please visit the feedback forum: <%= Copilot::COPILOT_FEEDBACK_FORUM %>
or visit our GitHub Copilot Learning Pathway to learn more: <%= Copilot::LEARNING_PATHWAY %>

Sincerely,
GitHub Copilot Team
