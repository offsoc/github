Hi @<%= @recipient %>,

<%= @whose_export %> Explore Sponsors results are attached to this email. If you want to sponsor many of these maintainers at once, you can modify the file using a tool like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or a text editor. Some things you can change:
1. Add other maintainers you want to sponsor who have a GitHub Sponsors profile. Fill in the "Maintainer username" column in the file.
2. Remove any maintainers who you don't want to sponsor.
3. Modify the "Sponsorship amount in USD" column for each maintainer to what you want to spend.
4. Upload the file to GitHub at <%= new_sponsors_bulk_sponsorship_imports_url(sponsor: @sponsor) %>

Visit the Bulk Sponsorships documentation for more information on how to use this feature: <%= GitHub.help_url %>/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor#sponsoring-accounts-in-bulk

You can also view the results from your export on the web at <%= sponsors_explore_index_url(@explore_params) %>
