  An additional `reactions` object in the issue comment payload is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the APIs may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-12-reactions-api-preview) for full details.

  To access the API you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.squirrel-girl-preview
  ```
  The `reactions` key will have the following payload where `url` can be used to construct the API location for [listing and creating](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/reactions/reactions) reactions.
