  New features in the Deployments API on GitHub are currently available during a public beta. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-10-16-deployments-environments-states-and-auto-inactive-updates/) for full details.

  To access the new `environment` parameter, the two new values for the `state` parameter (`in_progress` and `queued`), and use `auto_inactive` on production deployments during the public beta period, you must provide the following custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.flash-preview+json
  ```
