  > This endpoint is in beta and is subject to change.

  Purchases a GitHub Copilot seat for all users within each specified team.
  The organization will be billed accordingly. For more information about Copilot pricing, see "[Pricing for GitHub Copilot](${externalDocsUrl}/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot#about-billing-for-github-copilot)".

  Only organization owners can add Copilot seats for their organization members.

  In order for an admin to use this endpoint, the organization must have a Copilot Business or Enterprise subscription and a configured suggestion matching policy.
  For more information about setting up a Copilot subscription, see "[Setting up a Copilot subscription for your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/managing-your-github-copilot-subscription-for-your-organization-or-enterprise)".

  The response will contain the total number of new seats that were created and existing seats that were refreshed.
