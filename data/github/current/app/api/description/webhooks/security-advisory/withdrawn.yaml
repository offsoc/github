  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a global security advisory that was reviewed by GitHub. A GitHub-reviewed global security advisory provides information about security vulnerabilities or malware that have been mapped to packages in ecosystems we support. For more information about global security advisories, see "[About global security advisories](${externalDocsUrl}/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-global-security-advisories)." For information about the API to manage security advisories, see [the REST API documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories) or [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#securityadvisory).

  GitHub Dependabot alerts are also powered by the security advisory dataset. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](${externalDocsUrl}/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)."
