summary: Mark notifications as read
description: Marks all notifications as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is
  too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and
  ${apiName} will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To
  check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the [List notifications
  for the authenticated user](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/activity/notifications#list-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user)
  endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.
