summary: Update an existing authorization
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** ${apiName} will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](${externalDocsUrl}/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).

  If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."

  You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.
