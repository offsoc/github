        <p dir="auto">Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Really?! Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, but you can.

        <p dir="auto">Soon enough. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No, she'll probably make me do it. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>

        <p dir="auto">You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
        <p dir="auto">I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>

But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
