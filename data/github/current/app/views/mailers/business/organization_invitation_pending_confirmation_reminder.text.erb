Hello!

This is a friendly reminder that you have not yet confirmed the invitation for <%= @organization.name %> to join the <%= @business.name %> enterprise on GitHub.

To complete the transfer of ownership to <%= @business.name %>, follow this link:

<%= pending_organizations_enterprise_url(@business) %>

If not confirmed, the invitation will expire in <%= @until_expiry_in_words %>.

Some helpful tips:

- If you get a 404 page, make sure youâ€™re signed in as an owner of <%= @business.name %>.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
