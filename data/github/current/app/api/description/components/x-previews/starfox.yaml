  Project card details are now shown in REST API v3 responses for project-related issue and timeline events. This feature is now available for developers to preview. For details, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-09-05-project-card-events).

  To receive the `project_card` attribute, project boards must be [enabled](https://docs.github.com/articles/disabling-project-boards-in-a-repository) for a repository, and you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.starfox-preview+json
  ```
