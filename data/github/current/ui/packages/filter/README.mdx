# Filter

A reusable filter component offers suggestions and validation to users, creating a consistent search string for querying data.
It should not be confused with the [QueryBuilder](?path=/docs/recipes-querybuilder-readme--docs). For a clearer understanding of the differences, we recommend [this document](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-documentation-differences-from-querybuilder--docs).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example

<Box sx={{pt: 2}}>
  <Story of={FilterStories.Playground} />
</Box>

## üñåÔ∏è Guidelines

Before you decide to use this component it's recommended to [read our guidelines](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-documentation-guidelines--docs).

## ü§ì How to Use

Below is a simple example of a `Filter`:

```jsx
import {Filter} from '@github-ui/filter';
import {ProjectFilterProvider, LabelFilterProvider} from '@github-ui/filter/providers';

const filterData = useCallback((filter: string) => {
  // Call API with filter value
}, [])

const filterProviders = useMemo(()=> {
  return [
    new ProjectFilterProvider(),
    new LabelFilterProvider(),
  ]
}, [])

<Filter id="filter-example" label="Filter" onChange={filterData} providers={filterProviders}/>
```

The `Filter` only requires 3 props: ID for tracking and identification, a callback for when the filter changes, and an array of `FilterProvider` objects (more on those below). Note, this component does *not* do any filtering or querying of data. It is up to the consumer to provide the data and filter it. The `Filter` component will provide a consistent search string that can be used to query data.

### Providers

Filter providers are used to provide suggestions and validation to the filter component. They are passed in as an array of `FilterProvider` objects. For a list of prebuilt providers see the [Filter Providers](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-providers-standard--docs#standard-filter-providers) document. If you are looking to build your own provider see the [Custom FilterProviders](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-providers-custom--docs#building-a-custom-filterprovider) document.

### Properties

<Controls />

#### Filter Settings:

##### `aliasMatching`

*Default: false*

When `aliasMatching` is enabled, the filter will match against the alias of a filter in addition to the filter value and display name. This is useful when you want to provide a more user-friendly name for a filter or when a value has changed and want to softly direct a user to an updated value.

Example: `yes` and `no` are valid values for the `draft:true/faluse` when `aliasMatching` is enabled.

##### `disableAdvancedTextFilter`

*Default: false*

When `disableAdvancedTextFilter` is enabled, the advanced filter dialog's text filter will be disabled. This is useful when you want to restrict the user from entering in text values.

**Note**: This is **only** supported when the `filterVariant` is set to `button`. If the filter input is visible, the text filter will be enabled.

## üì¶ What's changed?

#### `is:open` and `is:closed` have been removed

The `is:open` and `is:closed` filters have been deprecated. They were duplicative of the `state` filter and were only
adding confusion. We recommend using `state:open` and `state:closed` instead.

*Note: State options can be enabled by setting `legacyState` setting to `true` for the `IsFilterProvider`, but it is deprecated and will be removed in the future.*

#### User-defined filters

We've created a [seperate section to guide you on implementing custom filters](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-documentation-user-defined-filters--docs) based on user content.

## ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility

When the results change in response to a filter change, use accessibility tools to broadcast the result count, such as managing focus and utilizing a live region to announce number of results.

## ü§ù Contribute

We're continually seeking to enhance and expand this component! To start, we suggest getting acquainted with the code.
