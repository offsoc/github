## Nested ListView

### Container

<img alt="Two empty rectangles stacked on top of each other. The top recangle is thin. The bottom rectangle is far larger. Combined they suggest the generic area a Nested ListView component can contain." src={imageContainer} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

A Nested ListView needs a container that can express the boundaries of its content. This container communicates the boundary area that the Nested ListView UI is placed in.

#### Container reference

The ListView component has documentation and logic already established for this subcomponent:

* [Markup for required DOM declarations](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#container)
* [Component code](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/list-view/src/ListView/ListView.tsx#L133)

### Title

<img alt="The two stacked rectangles used in the Nested ListView container example. A third purple rectangle has been placed above them to suggest the Nested ListView's visually hidden title area." src={imageContainerTitle} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

A title provides the Nested ListView with a concise, descriptive name that communicates what kind of content it contains.

A title can be configured to be either:

* Hidden visually, but still accessible to assistive technology, or
* Shown to all users.

Removing the `sr-only` class declared on the heading element will make the title visible to all users.

#### Title reference

The ListView component has documentation and logic already established for this subcomponent:

* [Markup and further explanation of required DOM declarations](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#container-title)
* [Component code](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/list-view/src/ListView/ListView.tsx#L135)

### Component-level expand/collapse toggle

<img alt="A title that reads, 'Sub-issues'. After it is a disc that is halfway filled, followed by the phrase '1/2'. The title has a chevron icon placed before it, indicating that its contents can be expanded or collapsed." src={imageTitleTally} />

This subcomponent is **optional**.

A component-level expand/collapse toggle allows the entire Nested ListView component to be placed into a more minimal, collapsed state.

When collapsed, the only visible content of the Nested ListView is its:

* Expand/collapse toggle UI,
* [Title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#title), and
* [Component-level completion tally](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#component-level-completion-tally) (if present).

When expanded, the Nested ListView displays all of its content.

A component author can set the Nested ListView instance to be initially displayed in either an expanded or collapsed state. Additionally, the expanded or collapsed state of the Nested ListView component does not persist across page loads.

Unlike [the ListItem node expand/collapse toggle](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#expandcollapse-toggle), the component-level expand/collapse toggle behaves like [a traditional disclosure control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/). It **does not** respond to [arrow keypresses](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-overview--overview#navigating-and-taking-action), as it is not part of the tree view construct portion of the component.

A Nested ListView title **cannot** contain interactive elements (links, buttons, etc.) if a component-level expand/collapse toggle is used.

#### Component-level expand/collapse toggle markup

```html
<div id="uuid-nested-list-view-container">
  <button button type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="uuid">
    <ChevronRightIcon size={16} />
    <hX id="uuid-list-view-container-title" class="sr-only">{title}</hX>
    <!-- Other Nested ListView content -->
  </button>
  <div>
    <ul
      role="tree"
      id="uuid"
      hidden
      aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
      <!-- Nested ListView ListItem parent nodes -->
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Notes:**

* A `button` element wraps the Nested ListView title.
  * A declaration of `type="button"` prevents the browser from attempting form submission if activated.
  * `aria-expanded` is also declared.
    * If the component is placed in a collapsed state, `aria-expanded`'s value is set to `false`. Additionally, `hidden` attribe is added to [the Nested ListView parent-level container](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#parent-level-container)'s `ul` element. This both visually hides the content and also removes its presence from assistive technology.
    * If the component is placed in an expanded state, `aria-expanded`'s value is set to `true`. Additionally, the `hidden` attribute is removed from the Nested ListView parent-level container's `ul` element. This shows the content visually and also restores its presence for assistive technology.
  * `aria-controls` is also declared. Its value points to the `id` value of the Nested ListView parent-level container's `ul` element. This reinforces the relationship of the disclosure toggle and the content it affects for assistive technology that support the declaration.
* The [chevron-right Octicon](https://primer.style/foundations/icons/chevron-right-16) is placed inside the `button` element, before the Nested ListView title's `hX` element.
  * The icon can be rotated 90Â° clockwise via [CSS's rotate() function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate) when `aria-expanded` is set to `true`.
  * Ensure that `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false" are also set on the chevron-right Octicon's parent `svg\` element.

### Component-level completion tally

<img alt="A title that reads, 'Sub-issues'. After it is a disc that is halfway filled, followed by the phrase '1/2'. The title has a chevron icon placed before it, indicating that its contents can be expanded or collapsed." src={imageTitleTally} />

This subcomponent is **optional**.

A Nested ListView can have a mechanism to quickly communicate the number of Issues present, as well as how many of them have been completed. The completion tally can be placed:

* On the parent component-level, to indicate how many top-level parent Issues are present, and also
* On a parent ListItem level, to indicate how many immediate child Issues are present.

The tally total is reflective of the number of direct descendants of the Issue, but not its nested child nodes. For example, a Nested ListVIew component instance has ten parent nodes. The total for the parent-level completion tally would be 10.

Closing immediate child Issues will update the tally to reflect the new total number of completed Issues. Removing or adding immediate child Issues will update the total number of Issues listed in the tally.

A parent component-level completion tally **cannot** be interactive, as it may be placed inside of a [component-level expand/collapse toggle](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#component-level-expandcollapse-toggle). Reference [ListItem completion tally tooltip considerations](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#overview-of-listitem-issue-node-anatomy#completion-tally-tooltip-considerations) for additional context.

#### Component-level completion tally markup

The tally is placed next to [the Nested ListView's title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#title) in this example:

```html
<div id="uuid-nested-list-view-container">
  <div>
    <!-- Nested ListView container title -->
    <div>
      <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><!-- SVG internals --></svg>
      <span aria-hidden="true">11 of 46</span>
      <span class="sr-only">11 of 46 Issues completed</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Other Nested ListView content -->
</div>
```

**Notes:**

* A wrapper `div` element is used to contain the title and tally, to help control visual layout.
* The `svg` element represents the completion tally graphic and is considered decorative.
  * It has `aria-hidden="true"` and focusable="false" declared on it to hide its presence from assistive technology, but show the UI visually.
  * If a SVG is not utilized, ensure that `aria-hidden="true"` and focusable="false" are applied to the parent-level element used to contain the graphic.
* The tally wrapper `div` element containing the completion tally should be placed immediately after the Nested ListView [title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#title).
* The first `span` element has `aria-hidden="true"` declared on it to hide its presence from assistive technology, but show the tally visually.
* The second `span` element has a `sr-only` class declared on it to hide the tally visually, but make it accessible to assistive technology.
  * Note the " Issues completed" string added after the total number of Issues in the second `span` element.

### Announcements

<img alt="The three stacked rectangles indicating the Nested ListView title and main content area. A fourth blue recangle that represents the visually hidden announcement area has been added after the title." src={imageContainerAnnouncements} />

**Note:** If the Nested ListView component is being used on GitHub.com, it can utilize [aria-live.ts](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/aria-live/aria-live.ts) to perform announcements.

This subcomponent is **required**.

A Nested ListView may not need to use the announcement subcomponent for all use cases, but should provide it in case an author provides content that requires it.

A user who cannot see the screen needs a mechanism to help reactively communicate feedback after certain actions are undertaken. Examples include confirmation of loading, deletion, duplication, etc.

There are two overall types of announcements a Nested ListView component can make:

1. Announcements that originate from **the current user's actions**.
2. Announcements that originate from **other user's actions** (ex: someone else on another device closing an Issue).

#### Reference for announcements that originate from the current user's actions

The ListView component has documentation and logic already established for this subcomponent:

* [Markup and further explanation of required DOM declarations](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#announcements).

### Announcements that originate from other user's actions

Nested ListViews can be updated by parallel user activity. An example of this would be someone on a separate device moving a parent ListItem two levels deeper and by placing it in a separate, deeper parent node.

If a user cannot see this activity they need a mechanism to communicate these sorts of events. This is especially important in circumstances where significant events have occurred, such as bulk applied actions, or large, structural changes.

#### Other users' presence

Other users' presence **is not** explicitly communicated. This includes visually, as well as to assistive technology. The only way to determine if other users are taking action on a Nested ListView is via their actions on ListItem content.

#### Focus management considerations

Focus **should not** be managed when these events occur. This allows a user to not be disrupted when other user's events occur.

Instead, a [polite `aria-live` announcement](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-live) should be made using [`aria-live.ts`](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/aria-live/aria-live.ts). A polite announcement is used because it should occur after announcements created from significant, user-initiated actions occur.

#### Disambiguating Nested ListView announcements

If more than one Nested ListView component instance is present on a page or view, the announcement should include the title of the Nested ListView component instance that is being updated. The inclusion of the title serves as a prefix placed before both:

1. [**Individual Issue event announcements**](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#individual-event-announcements), and
2. [**Summarized Issue announcements**](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#individual-event-announcements#collating-and-summarizing-announcements).

Both individual issue event announcements and summarized Issue announcements use a [polite `aria-live`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-live) attribute value.

Following is an example announcement from a design that has two Nested ListView component instances:

```
{title} list updated. {announcement}
```

**Notes:**

* `{title}` is a placeholder for the [Nested ListView title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#title).
  * This allows a user to understand which Nested ListView is updating, if more than one component instance is present.
  * Note the addition of " list updated." after the `{title}` placeholder. This helps a user to understand what the updates are being applied to.
* `{announcement}` is a placeholder for either a an individual Issue event announcement or a summarized Issue announcement.

#### Announcement content and priority

Following are examples of what and what does not qualify as actions that should be announced to assistive technology users, as well as the order of importance of the announcements.

##### Significant actions initiated by other users

Significant user-initiated actions **are** announced. They include, but are not limited to:

* One or more nodes being added to the Nested ListView.
* Moving one or more ListItem nodes to a different parent node.
* One or more ListItem nodes being closed.
* One or more ListItem nodes being deleted.
* Sort requests that **do** change the structure of the Nested ListView for other users.

##### Non-significant actions initiated by other users

Non-significant user-initiated actions **are not** announced. They include, but are not limited to:

* Assigning users to an Issue.
* Comment tallies being updated.
* Labels being added or removed.
* Issue titles being renamed.
* Issue types being updated.
* Metadata updates, such as timestamp changes.
* Sort requests that **don't** change the structure of the Nested ListView for other users.

##### Individual event announcements

[Significant actions initiated by other users](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#significant-actions-initiated-by-other-users) will trigger an announcement. This allows someone to be aware of important updates to the Nested ListView component's content.

###### Individual event announcement grammar

The grammar of the announcement should be in the past tense, as the action has already occurred. The following terms are used for each action:

| Action type | Action term |
|---|---|
| Node added | was added |
| Node moved | was moved |
| Issue closed | was closed |
| Node deleted | was deleted |
| Node removed | was removed |

These terms are used to construct an announcement. The structure is: `{nested listitem title/primary action} {action term}.`

For example, an Issue node getting added to the Nested ListView component would create the following announcement:

```
Epic: Intelligent Chatbot Support was added.
```

An issue node getting closed would create the following announcement:

```
Free and paid levels was closed.
```

##### Order of priority

The order of priority for announcements should be based on the significance of the event, and therefore the value to the user for understanding how the Nested ListView has reconfigured itself. This order is:

1. Node remove events (ex: Issue closing, deletion).
2. Node move events (ex: parent node becoming a child node).
3. Node add events (ex: Issue added).

##### Collating and summarizing announcements

Too many [individual events](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#individual-event-announcements) occurring in a short period of time can be overwhelming to a user.

A sighted user can quickly understand at a high level that many actions are occurring in a short span of time by visually scanning the page. They can also choose to ignore the visual updates and return to the Nested ListView component when it has settled down.

Similarly, announcing many actions occurring in a short amount of time verbatim can be too much to be useful. Instead, the announcements can provide a comparable experience to the visual one: a high-level indication that many actions have quickly taken place.

To accomplish this, events that occur in a set time period are:

1. Collated, and then
2. Summarized.

These events are all performed by users other than the current user.

The set time period is a window of **750ms**, starting from the first event's occurrence. If no other events occur within this window, the announcements are made as separate, discrete events. If another event occurs within this window, the timer is reset. Once the window closes a summarized announcement is made.

The [order of priority](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#order-of-priority) applies here, so that a user can understand both what happened, and what of those events are more impactful changes.

For example, the following events occur in the 750ms window of time:

* Issue 351 is closed.
* Issue 751 is moved laterally.
* Issue 147 is closed.
* Issue 527 is renamed.
* Issue 911 is deleted.
* Issue 530 is moved 2 levels deep.
* Issue 706 has its labels updated.
* Issue 943 is added.
* Issue 944 is added.
* Issue 340 is moved 5 levels deep.
* Issue 945 is added.
* Issue 476 is moved laterally.
* Issue 831 has its labels updated.
* Issue 923 is closed.
* Issue 677 has a user assigned to it.
* Issue 455 is moved laterally.

First, [non-significant events](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#non-significant-actions-initiated-by-other-users) (Issues 527, 706, 831, and 677) are discarded from consideration for announcement.

Second, the remaining [significant events](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#non-significant-actions-initiated-by-other-users) are grouped by type:

* Removal event Issues: 351, 147, 911, 923
* Move event Issues: 751, 530, 340, 476, 455
* Add event Issues: 943, 944, 945

Third, the grouped events are tallied and a high-level announcement then is created using this information. The [order of priority](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#order-of-priority) sets which tallied events are announced in what order:

```
{title} list updated. 4 removals. 5 moved. 3 added.
```

#### Threshhold for tallying

Also note that each of the three groups in the previous subsection has 3 or more announcements tallied.

If a group had less than 3 announcements, it would be left off:

```
{title} list updated. 57 removals. 125 added.
```

Announcements that don't meet the tally threshold are announced individually after the grouped event announcement. For example:

```
{title} list updated. 67 moved.
```

```
{title} list updated. Feature: Final creative shots from the game was closed.
```

**Note:** These would be two separate aria-live announcements.

#### Sort requests that change the structure of the Nested ListView for other users

These requests are destructive actions, and should be announced in order to inform the user the entire order of the tree view has changed. For example:

```
{title} list updated. Sorted by most commented.
```

##### Reconciliation of contradictory events

There may be a scenario where one user takes action on a Nested ListView that contradicts another user's action. For example, one user moves a ListItem node to a different parent node, but another user deletes it 1 millisecond later.

In situations like this, the most recent action should be the one that is announced. The other, earlier action is not announced.

### Header container, info, and bulk actions

<img alt="A long light gray rectangle that contains a checkbox, a link that says 'Open (999)', a link that says 'Closed (999)', and a sorting button labeled 'Newest'." src={imageHeaderContainerBulkActions} />

This subcomponent is **optional**.

**Note:** Use the [ListView.Metadata](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/list-view/src/ListView/Metadata.tsx) React component.

The header container provides an area for content such as title, selection of items in the nested list view, nested list view sorting criteria, expand/collapse trigger for the nested list view, display density toggling, and other bulk-level actions.

#### Header container, info, and bulk actions reference

The ListView component has documentation and logic already established for this subcomponent:

* [Markup and further explanation of required DOM declarations](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#metadata-container)
* [Component code](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/list-view/src/ListView/Metadata.tsx)
* [Examples of how to incorporate common metadata content and actions in an accessible way](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#metadata-content-and-bulk-actions)

### ListItem hierarchy and grouping

<img alt="The Nested ListView main content area. It shows how ListItem nodes can be nested eight levels deep, with the last issue returning to root-level depth." src={imageNesting} />

This subcomponent is **required**.

The tree view interaction model utilizes nested unordered lists to help programatically communicate parent/child relationsips to assistive technology. ARIA declarations also accompany these declarations.

Each ListItem Issue is a node on the tree view, and its parent `ul` element serves as the grouping mechanism. ListItem Issue nodes can be nested up to **eight** levels deep. Each ListItem Issue node can include **up to** 50 fifty child nodes.

Not all ListItem Issue nodes need to have children associated with them. Child nodes **cannot** be "orphaned", and need a parent node associated with them. Additionally, a child node cannot "skip" levels. For example, a child node cannot be a grandchild of a parent node.

Parent ListItem nodes **cannot** be "empty". If no child nodes are associated with them they will not have expand/collapse functionality.

### ListItem hierarchy and grouping reference

The TreeView component has documentation and logic already established for this subcomponent:

* [TreeView container, heading, and parent node](https://github.com/github/primer/blob/main/apis/tree-view-api.md#treeview-container-heading-and-parent-node)
* [A parent-level file](https://github.com/github/primer/blob/main/apis/tree-view-api.md#a-parent-level-file)

**Notes:**

* `role="tree"` declared on the parent `ul` element signals to assistive technology that a tree view construct is present.
* `role="treeitem"` declared on a child `li` element signals to assistive technology that the list item is a node in the tree view construct.
* `aria-level="1"` declared on a child `li` element signals to assistive technology the node's level of hierarchy/depth.

### ListItem hierarchy and grouping example markup

#### Parent-level container

This top-level `ul` contains the ARIA declarations and native semantics required to programatically communicate the presence of a tree view structure.

```html
<div id="uuid-nested-list-view-container">
  <!-- Nested ListView container title -->
  <!-- Nested ListView header -->
  <!-- Nested ListView announcements -->
  <ul
    role="tree"
    id="uuid"
    aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <!-- Nested ListView ListItem parent nodes -->
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Note:** The `uuid-title` portion of the `ul`'s `aria-labelledby="uuid-title"` declaration refers to [the Nested ListItem title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-list-view--docs#title).

#### Parent-level ListItem Issue node with no children

```html
<div id="uuid-nested-list-view-container">
  <!-- Nested ListView container title -->
  <!-- Nested ListView header -->
  <!-- Nested ListView announcements -->
  <ul
    role="tree"
    id="uuid"
    aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <!-- Other Nested ListView ListItem parent nodes -->
    <li
      id="uuid-node3"
      role="treeitem"
      tabindex="-1"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-level="1">
      <!-- ListView ListItem content -->
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Note:**

* The `li` element's native semantics, combined with the ARIA declarations communicate the ListItem node's presence and level of hierarchy.
* The `tabindex` delcaration is part of [the roving tabindex technique](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-overview--overview#focus-management-and-node-traversal).
* The `id` is used to help programatically communicate node parent/child relationships.

#### Parent-level ListItem Issue node with child nodes

```html
<div id="uuid-nested-list-view-container">
  <!-- Nested ListView container title -->
  <!-- Nested ListView header -->
  <!-- Nested ListView announcements -->
  <ul
    role="tree"
    id="uuid"
    aria-labelledby="uuid-title">
    <!-- Other Nested ListView ListItem parent nodes -->
    <li
      id="uuid-node3"
      role="treeitem"
      tabindex="-1"
      aria-selected="false"
      aria-level="1">
      <!-- ListView ListItem content -->
      <ul
        aria-labelledby="uuid-node3-link"
        role="group">
        <!-- Nested ListView ListItem child nodes -->
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

**Note:**

* A `ul` element is placed inside the parent `li` element to programatically communicate the child node grouping.
* The `ul` element's native semantics, combined with the ARIA declarations communicate the boundaries of the ListItem child nodes.
* The `uuid-node3-link` portion of the `ul`'s `aria-labelledby="uuid-node3-link"` declaration is documented in [the NestedListItem's primary action/title](?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view-documentation-accessibility-listitem--docs#titleprimary-action-example-markup).
