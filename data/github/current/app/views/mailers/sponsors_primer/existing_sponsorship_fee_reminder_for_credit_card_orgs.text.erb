Hi @<%= @org %>,

A reminder, your current recurring sponsorships will be subject to a <%= Sponsorship::PERCENT_SPONSORSHIP_FEE_FOR_CREDIT_CARD_ORGS %>% fee after <%= Sponsorship::SPONSORS_FEES_FOR_EXISTING_SPONSORSHIPS_DATE_TEXT %>. If you'd like to switch to invoiced billing to save 3%, visit our documentation (<%= @invoiced_billing_docs_url %>) for details, and let us know how we can help.

Also as of <%= Sponsorship::SPONSORS_PUBLIC_RELEASE_DATE_TEXT %>, any new sponsorships you make are subject to a <%= Sponsorship::PERCENT_SPONSORSHIP_FEE_FOR_CREDIT_CARD_ORGS %>% fee. This fee is inclusive of a 3% credit card processing fee and a 3% GitHub service processing fee. If you choose to pay by invoice, your organization will be subject to only the 3% GitHub service processing fee. Check out our blog for full details on what's new with Sponsors: <%= @blog_post_url %>

While we shared at launch (<%= @beta_blog_post_url %>) that we would eventually introduce fees into the program, we wanted to do so in a way we believed would best support the ecosystem. We've worked hard to determine a fee structure that aligns with the goals of the program while addressing the costs of processing payments.

Thank you for your continued support of the open source community.

Best,
GitHub Sponsors
