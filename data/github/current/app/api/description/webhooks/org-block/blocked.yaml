summary: |-
  This event occurs when organization owners or moderators block or unblock a non-member from collaborating on the organization's repositories. For more information, see "[Blocking a user from your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization)." For information about the APIs to manage blocked users, see [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#userblockedevent) or "[Blocking users](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/orgs/blocking)" in the REST API documentation.

  If you want to receive an event when members are added or removed from an organization, use the `organization` event instead.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Administration" organization permission.
