Hi <%= @invitation.email_or_invitee_name %>,

Your invitation to the <%= @org.safe_profile_name %> organization on GitHub has been canceled. Links to the invitation in previous emails will no longer work.

If this is unexpected, reach out to the owners of <%= @org.safe_profile_name %>.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
