# `ui-commands`: Centralized, documented UI Actions that may be bound to keyboard shortcuts

## Core concepts

`ui-commands` is a platform for registering actions (*commands*) that a user can take in a web UI. Some examples of
these actions include submitting a form, clicking a button, focusing an input, or navigating to a page.

Commands **may** be assigned a default keybinding that allows them to be triggered by a keyboard shortcut. Eventually, users
will be able to customise these keybindings as they please. In addition, commands can be triggered by other events (like
clicking a button). So, while the concept of commands and keyboard shortcuts are linked, it is important
[not to think of commands and keyboard shortcuts as the same thing](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/keyboard-shortcuts/inaccessible-default-keyboard-shortcuts.md#ask-whether-you-need-a-default-keybinding-in-the-first-place).

Initially, an app moving on to this platform will likely limit the registered commands to those actions that already
had keyboard shortcuts. However, the long-term goal here should be to register **all** user interface actions as commands -
even those that will not have keybindings by default. This will allow users to fully customize their experience, creating
keybindings for the actions they take most frequently in their role.

## Registering commands

Commands are grouped into services, each defined in a single `commands.json` metadata file in a `github-ui` package.
Commands can be defined at the application level (`/ui/packages/pull-requests/commands.json`, for example) or at the
component level (`/ui/packages/markdown-editor/commands.json`).

Commands can be referenced and used outside of the package they are located in. For example, Repositories might define
all their commands in a `repositories` package but still refer to them in a `repositories-settings` package. For now,
only one commands service may be defined per package.

To get started, create `commands.json` next to your package's `package.json`. The JSON should follow this format:

```jsonc
// Yes, commands.json files support comments!
{
  // required: Unique service ID, hyphen-separated
  "serviceId": "pull-requests",
  // required: Publicly visible name, for docs / UI
  "serviceName": "Pull Requests",
  "commands": {
    // Unique command ID, hyphen-separated
    "request-reviewers": {
      // required: Publicly visible name, for docs / UI
      "name": "Request reviewers",
      // required: Publicly visible description
      "description": "Open and focus the reviewers picker.",
      // optional: A default keyboard shortcut to bind to this command
      "defaultBinding": "q",
      // optional: Feature flag that gates this command (see 'Feature flagging commands' below)
      "featureFlag": "memex_table_selection"
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

> **WARNING:**
> All metadata in the `commands.json` file is user-facing. Do not include any internal information in this file.

If you are using VSCode, the file will be validated automatically in your editor. Otherwise, you can run
`npm run ui-commands:validate` to check the format. The `defaultBinding` is validated via ESLint to provide detailed
error messages and autofixes wherever possible.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The command metadata must be compiled before the commands can be used by your app. After updating a `commands.json`
> file, always run `npm run ui-commands:compile` before continuing. This will also happen automatically when a
> development server is started and/or running in "watch" mode, or when running tests.

### Feature flagging commands

Commands can be feature flagged by providing a flag name to the `featureFlag` property. Feature flags that gate
commands **must** be added to the list in `lib/github/client_side_feature_flags.rb` so the client
can read them. Otherwise, the command will always be disabled.

When the flag is off, the command will not be activatable, it will be hidden from the keyboard shortcuts dialog, and any
corresponding (command-bound components)\[#command-bound-components] will not be rendered.

For testing, feature flags should be mocked using `mockClientEnv` from `@github-ui/client-env/mock`:

```tsx
beforeEach(() => {
  mockClientEnv({
    featureFlags: ['memex_table_selection'],
  })
})
```

### Assigning default keybindings

The `defaultBinding` field of a command defines the default keyboard shortcut to activate that command. Before
assigning a default keybinding to a command, please review the [accessibility documentation](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/keyboard-shortcuts/inaccessible-default-keyboard-shortcuts.md#general-guidelines-for-good-keybinding-design-use-your-best-judgment-please)
and consider whether one is necessary.

Default keybindings are defined using a subset of the [`hotkey`](https://github.com/github/hotkey) string format to
ensure consistency and cross-platform support:

1. Individual keys in a chord (multiple keys pressed at once) are separated with the `+` character: `Mod+j`
   * Because `+` is a special character, the key name `Plus` represents this key
2. Chords or keys in a sequence (pressed quickly one after the other) are separated with spaces: `a b`
   * Because ` ` is a special character, the key name `Space` represents this key
3. Available modifier keys are `Mod`, `Alt`, and `Shift`, and must be combined in that order: `Alt+x`, `Mod+Shift+G`, `Mod+Alt+f`, `Mod+Alt+Shift+6`
   * Note that `Control` and `Meta` are not allowed - instead, use the special cross-platform `Mod` modifier which represents `Command` (`Meta`) on MacOS and `Control` on other operating systems
4. Key names are case sensitive and match what the [the `KeyboardEvent.key` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values) would be. This means:
   1. Non-character key names are in PascalCase: `PageUp`, `ArrowLeft`, `F6`
   2. When `Shift` is a modifier, the key must be 'uppercase' as typed: `Shift+A`, `Alt+Shift+?`, `Shift+&`, `Mod+Shift+X`
   3. Otherwise, the key must be lowercase: `a`, `/`, `Alt+8`, `Mod+h`

In addition to the specified syntax, accessibility **must** be considered when assigning default keybindings. Please
refer to the [*Inaccessible default keyboard shortcuts*](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/keyboard-shortcuts/inaccessible-default-keyboard-shortcuts.md)
document for a list of which keybindings should be avoided and how to choose a good one. To the extent possible, these
accessibility guidelines are enforced via ESLint.

### Site-wide commands

Some commands are standardized across GitHub and should not be defined for each individual service. For example,
`github:submit-form` should always be used for form submission.

Site-wide commands are defined in the `github` service in the `ui-commands` package (`/ui/packages/ui-commands/commands.json`).

## Associating commands with effects

A command is nothing if it doesn't *do* anything when activated. For this, you must bind command events to effects
within your React application.

Be sure to run `npm run ui-commands:compile` as noted above to update the TypeScript types before continuing.

Commands can either be 'scoped' to a section of the interface or 'global' across the current page:

### Global commands

The [`GlobalCommands`](https://ui.githubapp.com/storybook/?path=/story/recipes-ui-commands-globalcommands--global-commands-example)
component binds a keydown listener to the `window.document` object when it is mounted, and unbinds the
command when it is unmounted. This means that the command can be activated as long as the component is rendered,
regardless of where focus is located -- even outside of the React app boundary.

Global commands are defined with the `GlobalCommands` React component:

```tsx
<GlobalCommands commands={{'repositories:navigate-to-code': navigateToCode}} />
```

### Scoped commands

Scoped commands can only be activated when focus is contained in some part of the page. The same scoped
commands can be declared in multiple places on a page For example, a "Comment on line" command in a pull
request review UI would be scoped to each line of code so that, when activated, the command appears on the line the
user is currently focusing.

Scoped commands are bound with the [`ScopedCommands`](https://ui.githubapp.com/storybook/?path=/story/recipes-ui-commands-scopedcommands--scoped-commands-example)
React component:

```tsx
<ScopedCommands
  commands={{
    'pull-requests:comment-on-line': handleCommentOnLine,
    'github:open-context-menu': openContextMenu,
  }}
>
  <PullRequestDiffLine />
</ScopedCommands>
```

With this declaration, the provided commands can only be activated when focus is on or inside the line. The focus scope
is based on React synthetic event bubbling, meaning it works even if focus is contained within a [portal](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal)
(e.g., an `ActionMenu` overlay).

### `preventDefault` by default

For keyboard-activated commands, whether provided using `GlobalCommands` or `ScopedCommands`, `preventDefault` and
`stopPropagation` are always called on the underlying event if a handler is bound. This ensures consistent handling
of events: we will never accidentally trigger browser behavior at the same time as a command is handled. In cases
where this should not happen, such as a navigation shortcut to a page the user cannot access, the command should
simply not be bound. For example:

```tsx
<GlobalCommands commands={{'projects:navigate-to-settings': isAdmin ? navigateToSettings : undefined}} />
```

## Command-bound components

At this point you've defined the label and a handler for your command. Since commands represent interface actions,
you also probably have a button on the page with a similar label and handler. This is redundant - why do you need two
handlers for the same action? Why not just define a button that triggers your command in the same way the keybinding would?

Three *command-bound components* are provided to solve this problem. They extend standard Primer components but
automatically derive their labels from the command metadata and dispatch command events when activated.

* `CommandButton`: Extends Primer [`Button`](https://primer.style/react/Button), assigning an `onClick` handler and setting the button text to the command name
* `CommandIconButton`: Extends Primer [`IconButton`](https://primer.style/react/IconButton), assigning an `onClick` handler and setting the `aria-label` to the command name
* `CommandActionListItem`: Extends Primer [`ActionList.Item`](https://primer.style/react/ActionList), assigning an `onSelect`
  handler, setting the item text to the command name, and automatically rendering a keybinding hint as a trailing visual

With these components, you can easily render interactive UI elements without duplication, and you can ensure that
actions are always handled consistently.

Usage is straightforward: to render a "Submit comment" button, use the `CommandButton` component with a `commandId`:

```diff
- <Button onClick={submitComment}>Submit comment</Button>
+ <CommandButton commandId="issues:submit-comment" />
```

`CommandIconButton` works similarly, automatically applying an `aria-label` so you only need to set an icon:

```diff
- <IconButton aria-label="Copy commit hash" onClick={copyCommitHash} icon={CopyIcon} />
+ <CommandIconButton commandId="commits:copy-hash" icon={CopyIcon} />
```

`CommandActionListItem` works in [`ActionList`](https://primer.style/react/ActionList) or [`ActionMenu`](https://primer.style/react/ActionMenu) and automatically renders hints for configured keybindings:

```diff
- <ActionList.Item onSelect={copyAnchorLink}>
-   Copy anchor link
-   <ActionList.TrailingVisual>
-     <CommandKeybindingHint commandId="pull-requests:copy-anchor-link" />
-   </ActionList.TrailingVisual>
- </ActionList.Item>
+ <CommandActionListItem commandId="pull-requests:copy-anchor-link" />
```

## Rendering keybinding hints

To make shortcuts discoverable, it is often useful to render hints in the UI. However, because users will ultimately
be able to override keybindings, it's critical not to hardcode any keybindings. To solve this problem, the `ui-commands`
package provides another component: `CommandKeybindingHint`. This component simply accepts a full command ID and renders
the corresponding keybinding:

```tsx
<CommandKeybindingHint commandId="issues:comment-and-close" />
```

If there is no keybinding for the given command, the component will render nothing (`null`).

The display format can be customized with the same props as [`KeyboardKey`](https://ui.githubapp.com/storybook/?path=/story/recipes-keyboardkey--condensed).

Note that this component is often unecessary due to the availability of `CommandActionListItem` as described above.

In rare cases, it may be necessary to build accessible names or descriptions that contain a keybinding hint. While this
should nearly always be done by referencing a `CommandKeybindingHint` using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`,
`getAccessibleKeybindingString` is provided to use when this is not possible (ie, when building plain strings to use
in `aria-label` or `aria-description`).

## Observability

The `ui-commands` platform provides instrumentation automatically - no additional setup is required.

All command trigger events are automatically published to Hydro as `analytics.v0.BrowserEvent`s under the [`ui-commands`](https://hydro.githubapp.com/hydro_analytics/apps/ui-commands)
application with the `"command.trigger"` event type. In addition to the [automatically populated details](https://github.com/github/hydro-analytics-client/blob/main/docs/api.md#event-payload) about the browser and page,
additional context parameters are documented by the `CommandTriggerEvent` type in [`metrics.ts`](./metrics.ts).

### Querying event data

Command events can be queried in the [Data Warehouse](https://data.githubapp.com/sql) as described in the [frontend observability documentation](https://thehub.github.com/epd/engineering/dev-practicals/frontend/observability/browser-events/).

The `command_id` context parameter is the full command ID in `service:command` form, so you can filter for just your
app's commands with `starts_with`:

```sql
select * from hive_hydro.hydro.analytics_v0_browser_event
where app = 'ui-commands'
  and event = 'command.trigger'
  and starts_with(context['command_id'], '$YOUR_SERVICE_ID:')
limit 5
```
