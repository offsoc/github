summary: Create a custom organization role
description: |-
  Creates a custom organization role that can be assigned to users and teams, granting them specific
  permissions over the organization and optionally across all repositories in the organization. For
  more information on custom organization roles, see "[Managing people's access to your organization with roles](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-organization-roles)."

  To include repository permissions in an organization role, you must also include the `base_role`
  field, which is one of `read`, `write`, `triage`, `maintain`, or `admin` (or `none` if no base role is set). This base role provides a set of
  fine-grained permissions as well as implicit permissions - those that aren't exposed as fine-grained permissions
  and can only be granted through the base role (like "reading a repo").  If you include repository permissions, those
  permissions apply across all of the repositories in the organization. You do not have to include organization permissions
  in order to add repository permissions.

  See "[List repository permissions](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/orgs/custom-roles#list-repository-fine-grained-permissions-for-an-organization)" for valid repository permissions.

  To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must be one of:

  - An administrator for the organization.
  - A user, or a user on a team, with the fine-grained permissions of `write_organization_custom_org_role` in the organization.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
