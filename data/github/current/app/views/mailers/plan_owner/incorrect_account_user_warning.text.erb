Dear <%= @user %>,

During recent maintenance, we discovered that your private repository <%= @nwo %> is associated with the incorrect account for billing purposes. We will update this repository to associate it with your account.

If you are OK with its contents becoming publicly available, within the next three days you can make the repository public from its settings page:

https://github.com/<%= @nwo %>/settings

<% if @paid %>
If you would like to continue using it as a private repository, you will need to upgrade your plan or remove an existing private repository to make room under your current plan:

https://github.com/settings/billing

If you don’t take action, in three days <%= @nwo %> will be locked until you reduce the number of private repositories under your account, upgrade your plan, or make <%= @nwo %> public.
<% else %>
If you would like to continue using it as a private repository, you will need to sign up for a paid plan:

https://github.com/settings/billing

If you don’t take action, in three days <%= @nwo %> will be locked until you make the repository public or sign up for a paid plan.
<% end %>

Please reply to this email or <%= GitHub.support_link_text_no_please %> if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Nathan
