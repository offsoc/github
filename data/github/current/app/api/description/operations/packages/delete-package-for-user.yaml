summary: Delete a package for a user
description: |-
  Deletes an entire package for a user. You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.

  If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, the authenticated user must have admin permissions to the package. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
