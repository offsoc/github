summary: Force cancel a workflow run
description: |-
  Cancels a workflow run and bypasses conditions that would otherwise cause a workflow execution to continue, such as an `always()` condition on a job.
  You should only use this endpoint to cancel a workflow run when the workflow run is not responding to [`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/cancel`](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#cancel-a-workflow-run).

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
