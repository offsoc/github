summary: Delete a team (Legacy)
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Delete a team](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/teams#delete-a-team) endpoint.

  To delete a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or team maintainer.

  If you are an organization owner, deleting a parent team will delete all of its child teams as well.
