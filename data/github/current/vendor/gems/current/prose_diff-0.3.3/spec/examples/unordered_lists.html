It contains Jekyll (+ related dependencies), tests, and a simple build script. See the <a href="https://github.com/github/github/pull/3398">pull request that started it all</a> for background. In short, GitHub creates a resque job which shells out to <code>script/page-build</code>.</p>

      <p>GitHub Pages should be wholly reliant on, but not inextricably linked to GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise. It should serve as a semi-independent web service which builds pages and and responds to queries like requests for build history via standard web services. Beyond potentially dashboards and feedback, there should be no Pages-specific build logic within the codebase of GitHub.com (the website).</p>

      <p>GitHub Pages is not the WordPress.com of Jekyll, nor is it the Geocities of this decade, despite our propensity for animated gifs. GitHub Pages should be in support and a logical extension of the GitHub.com experience and should behave accordingly. @mentions, emoji, and GitHub flavored markdown should be just at home on a Pages site as they would within an issue on GitHub.com.</p>

      <p>GitHub Pages is also not just about technical documentation. Although that was its initial use case, and will remain its primary use case for the foreseeable future, Pages has a strong history of being a platform for discussions within the tech community from personal sites five years ago to proposed legislation today.</p>

      <h2>
      <a name="vision" class="anchor" href="#vision"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vision</h2>

      <p>GitHub Pages is the best place to quickly publish beautiful pages for you and your projects. It absorbs the complexity of collaborative publishing on behalf of its users. Like the rest of GitHub, GitHub Pages prides itself on its user experience, particularly the zen-like simplicity it provides content publishers at varying levels of technical proficiency.</p>

      <h3>
      <a name="customers" class="anchor" href="#customers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customers</h3>

      <p>GitHub Pages serve three primary customers:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Developers</strong> - Developers use GitHub Pages to publish technical documentation in support of the software they develop on GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise and represent our primary use case. When you think of developers, think of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Hackers</strong> - Hackers use GitHub Pages to publish beautiful static sites that aren't necessary technical documentation, although both the users and the content are often somewhat technical in nature. When you think hackers think <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">personal blogs</a> and <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">the White House Open Data Policy</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Hubbers</strong> - We use GitHub to build GitHub, and Pages should be no exception. GitHub Pages serves internal customers with the same care it serves the public. This may be in support of internal only efforts (like ux.githubapp.com) or front facing efforts maintained by Hubbers (like government.github.com). When you think Hubbers, think <a href="http://choosealicence.com">Choosealicense.com</a> or <a href="http://help.github.com">help</a>.</p></li>

      </h3>

      <p>Our customers love publishing using GitHub Pages. Whether its the steps we take to minimize the barrer to entry by providing resources for getting started at <a href="http://pages.github.com">pages.github.com</a> and <a href="http://help.github.com">help.github.com</a>, the care with which our support team - armed with the proper tools — answers each individual request, or the dedication with which we work with the Ops team  to ensure near-perfect speed and uptime, our users our proud to say they publish using GitHub Pages and do so often.</p>

      <p>We also work closely with the Jekyll community to ensure that GitHub Pages remains a consistent and optimal experience, that developers are empowered to diagnose troubled builds locally, and that subsequent upgrades are as seamless as possible for developers and maintainers alike.</p>

      <h3>
      <a name="content-as-code" class="anchor" href="#content-as-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Content as Code</h3>

      <p>In addition to providing an avenue to quickly publish your content, GitHub Pages is also a vehicle to teach The GitHub Way, encouraging its users to treat their prose with the same respect that developers treat their code — branches, commits, pull requests, and flow.</p>
