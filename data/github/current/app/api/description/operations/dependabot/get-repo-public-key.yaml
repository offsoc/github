summary: Get a repository public key
description: |-
  Gets your public key, which you need to encrypt secrets. You need to
  encrypt a secret before you can create or update secrets. Anyone with read access
  to the repository can use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint if the repository is private.
