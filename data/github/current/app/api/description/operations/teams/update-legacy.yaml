  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Update a team](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/teams#update-a-team) endpoint.

  To edit a team, the authenticated user must either be an organization owner or a team maintainer.

  > [!NOTE]
  > With nested teams, the `privacy` for parent teams cannot be `secret`.
