Hey <%= @user.display_login %>!

We wanted to let you know that we have removed your fallback SMS number for two-factor authentication as it was the same as your configured SMS number.

Two-factor authentication is still enabled on your account and SMS delivery is configured for a number ending in <%= @number %>.

If you would like to review your two-factor authentication configuration or configure a new fallback SMS number, visit https://github.com/settings/security

To see this and other security events for your account, visit https://github.com/settings/security-log

If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting https://github.com/contact

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
