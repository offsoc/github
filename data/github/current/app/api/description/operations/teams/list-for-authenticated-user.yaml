summary: List teams for the authenticated user
description: |-
  List all of the teams across all of the organizations to which the authenticated
  user belongs.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `user`, `repo`, or `read:org` scope to use this endpoint.

  When using a fine-grained personal access token, the resource owner of the token must be a single organization, and the response will only include the teams from that organization.
