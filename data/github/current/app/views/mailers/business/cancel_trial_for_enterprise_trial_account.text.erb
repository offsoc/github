Hi <%= @actor.name %>,

Your GitHub Enterprise trial, <%= @business.name %>, has been <%= @cancelled_flavor %>.

This means we have removed all members and administrators from the trial account, detached any organizations upgraded
or transferred into the trial and reverted back to their previous plan, and restricted access to all organizations
created as part of the trial.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
