Description:
    Creates a gh/gh seed runner and corresponding tests.

    --codespace makes the seed run during the pre-build process of the default gh/gh codespace, making the data
    available for everyone who launches that codespace.

    --codespace_devcontainer_name lets you pass the name of a specific devcontainer to run the seed in during the
    pre-build process, so users who launch that container will have the data available.


    Note that all devcontainers run the default seeds, specific dev containers optionally run additional seeds.

Example:
    bin/rails generate seed CreateSampleData --codespace --codespace_devcontainer_name example

    This will create:
        .devcontainer/example/seeds/#{TIMESTAMP}_create_sample_data.rb
        script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data.rb
        test/script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data_test.rb

    bin/rails g seed CreateSampleData --codespace

    This will create:
        .devcontainer/seeds/#{TIMESTAMP}_create_sample_data.rb
        script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data.rb
        test/script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data_test.rb

    bin/rails g seed CreateSampleData

    This will create:
        script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data.rb
        test/script/seeds/runners/create_sample_data_test.rb
