  You can set the visibility of a repository using the new `visibility` parameter in the [Repositories API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/repos), and get a repository's visibility with a new response key. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-12-03-internal-visibility-changes/).

  To access repository visibility during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.nebula-preview+json
  ```
