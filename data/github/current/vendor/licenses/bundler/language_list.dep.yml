    I don't actually know the license for this project. The project contains countries from the ISO language list although they were not obtained from the ISO website. The country list has been adapted and placed in data/languages.yml, so that it can be replaced if required.

    All of the code (everything except data/languages.yml) in this project is released under an MIT license.
