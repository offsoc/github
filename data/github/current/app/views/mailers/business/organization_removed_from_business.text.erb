Hello!

The <%= @organization.name %> organization has been removed from the <%= @business.name %> enterprise.

The following changes have been made:

- Billing, identity management, 2FA requirements, and other policies are no longer governed by the <%= @business.name %> enterprise.
<% if @plan %>
- The organization has been reverted to the <%= @plan %> plan.
<% else %>
- The organization has been downgraded to the free plan.
<% end %>
- Any internal repositories within the organization have been converted to private repositories.

<% if @removed_org_add_payment_info_or_contact_sales %>
While the <%= @organization.name %> organization has been reverted to the <%= @plan %> plan, payment information
needs to be added. Please follow this link to add your payment information:
<%= settings_org_billing_tab_url(organization_id: @organization.display_login, tab: "payment_information") %>

If you require invoiced payments instead, follow this link to contact our sales team:
https://github.com/enterprise/contact?ref_page=/pricing&ref_cta=Contact%20Sales&ref_loc=cards".
<% end %>

If this was unexpected, please confirm with other owners of the enterprise or organization, or contact GitHub Support at <%= contact_url %>.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
