Dear <%= @org %> owners team,

During recent maintenance we discovered that your private fork <%= @nwo %>’s parent repository <%= @parent_nwo %> is public. Although at one point we allowed the creation of private forks from public repositories this has not been the case for some time.

To protect your code’s privacy we don’t automatically make a fork public to match the parent repository. Instead, <%= @nwo %> will be unforked in three days and become a new private repository under the your organization’s account.

If you would prefer that <%= @nwo %> remain a fork of <%= @parent_nwo %>, and you are OK with its contents becoming publicly available, within the next three days you can make the fork public from its settings page:

https://github.com/<%= @nwo %>/settings

If you would like to continue using the fork as a private repository, you will need to upgrade your plan or remove an existing private repository to make room under your current plan:

https://github.com/organizations/<%= @org %>/settings/billing

If you don’t take action, in three days <%= @nwo %> will be unforked and locked until you reduce the number of private repositories under the organization account, upgrade the organization plan, or make <%= @nwo %> public.

Please reply to this email or <%= GitHub.support_link_text_no_please %> if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jesse
