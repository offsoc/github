summary: List SAML SSO authorizations for an organization
description: |-
  Lists all credential authorizations for an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO). The credentials are either personal access tokens or SSH keys that organization members have authorized for the organization. For more information, see [About authentication with SAML single sign-on](${externalDocsUrl}/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on).

  The authenticated user must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:org` scope to use this endpoint.
