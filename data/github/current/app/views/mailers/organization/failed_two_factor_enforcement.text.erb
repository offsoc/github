Hi @<%= @actor.display_login %>,

You attempted to enable the two-factor authentication requirement for the organization:

"<%= @organization.safe_profile_name %>"

<% if @enterprise_team_member_removal_failure %>
Enabling the requirement was not successful because the attempted removal of a member of the organization is part of an enterprise team. Please remove the user from the enterprise team and try again.
The user(s) that need to be removed can be viewed in the organizationâ€™s two-factor enforcement enablement dialog.
<% else %>
Enabling the requirement was not successful. Please try again.
<% end %>

<%= settings_org_security_url(@organization) %>

Cheers & Octocats,
