summary: Delete a grant
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** ${apiName} will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](${externalDocsUrl}/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/) will be removed on November 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).

  Deleting an OAuth application's grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated with the application for your user. Once deleted, the application has no access to your account and is no longer listed on [the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).
