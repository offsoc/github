summary: List repository teams
description: |-
  Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are also visible to the authenticated user.

  For a public repository, a team is listed only if that team added the public repository explicitly.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `public_repo` or `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a public repository, and `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
