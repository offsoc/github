summary: Get community profile metrics
description: |-
  Returns all community profile metrics for a repository. The repository cannot be a fork.

  The returned metrics include an overall health score, the repository description, the presence of documentation, the
  detected code of conduct, the detected license, and the presence of ISSUE\_TEMPLATE, PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE,
  README, and CONTRIBUTING files.

  The `health_percentage` score is defined as a percentage of how many of
  the recommended community health files are present. For more information, see
  "[About community profiles for public repositories](${externalDocsUrl}/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories)."

  `content_reports_enabled` is only returned for organization-owned repositories.
