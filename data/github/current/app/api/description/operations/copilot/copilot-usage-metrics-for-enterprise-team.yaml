summary: 'Get Copilot usage metrics for an enterprise team'
description: |-
  TODO: Add description

  The response contains metrics for up to 28 days prior. Usage metrics are processed once per day for the previous day,
  and the response will only include data up until yesterday. In order for an end user to be counted towards these metrics,
  they must have telemetry enabled in their IDE.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This endpoint will only return results for a given day if the enterprise team had **five or more members with active Copilot licenses**, as evaluated at the end of that day.

  Owners and billing managers for the enterprise that contains the enterprise team can view Copilot usage metrics for the enterprise team.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot` or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.
