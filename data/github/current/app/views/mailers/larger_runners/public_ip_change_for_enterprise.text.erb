Upgrade to continue using GitHub Actions Public IP Ranges

Your enterprise <%= @account.name %> account's billing plan has recently changed
and you will no longer have access to the Public IP feature for GitHub-hosted runners.

This affects any member organizations using this feature as well enterprise-shared runners.

You can recover these IP ranges if you upgrade your plan, otherwise they will be permanently deleted in 3 days.

Upgrade <%= @account.name %> Plan: <%= @upgrade_link %>

<% if @affected_enterprise_pools.any? %>
  Below is a list of the enterprise shared runners which were using fixed IP ranges:
    <% @affected_enterprise_pools.each do |name| %>
      <%= name %>
    <% end %>
<% end %>

<% if @affected_member_orgs.any? %>
  Below is a list of any member organization(s) which were using fixed IP ranges:
    <% @affected_member_orgs.each do |name| %>
      <%= name %>
    <% end %>
<% end %>

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
