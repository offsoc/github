summary: Create reaction for a team discussion
description: |-
  Create a reaction to a [team discussion](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/discussions#get-a-discussion).

  A response with an HTTP `200` status means that you already added the reaction type to this team discussion.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/:org_id/team/:team_id/discussions/:discussion_number/reactions`.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `write:discussion` scope to use this endpoint.
