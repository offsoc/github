  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** ${apiName} will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](${externalDocsUrl}/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).
