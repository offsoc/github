Updated Terms of Service and new Site Policy repository
------------------------------------------------------------

We’re updating our Terms of Service (<%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/github-terms-of-service/) and Corporate Terms of Service (<%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/github-corporate-terms-of-service/). These revisions are the result of community feedback, along with clarifications and improvements to the readability of both documents. All changes are in separate pull requests in a new working repository, github/site-policy (https://github.com/github/site-policy). Here, you can view, comment, and suggest additional updates—or fork a copy to adapt for your own site.

Please submit your comments by 5:00 pm PST on Friday, July 28. After that, we’ll take a week to go through your comments and make changes to improve the Terms. The new Terms will become effective on Monday, August 7.


Pull requests welcome
