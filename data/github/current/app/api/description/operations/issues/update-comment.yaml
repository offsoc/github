summary: Update an issue comment
description: |-
  You can use the REST API to update comments on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
