summary: Get required workflow usage
description: |-
  Gets the number of billable minutes used by a specific required workflow during the current billing cycle.

  Billable minutes only apply to required workflows running in private repositories that use ${apiName}-hosted runners. Usage is listed for each ${apiName}-hosted runner operating system in milliseconds. Any job re-runs are also included in the usage. The usage does not include the multiplier for macOS and Windows runners and is not rounded up to the nearest whole minute. For more information, see "[Managing billing for GitHub Actions](${externalDocsUrl}/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/managing-billing-for-github-actions)."

  Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.

  If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
