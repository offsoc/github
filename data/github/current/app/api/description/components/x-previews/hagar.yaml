  You can now retrieve someone's hovercard information in different contexts using the Hovercard API. This feature is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-03-21-hovercard-api-preview) for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.hagar-preview+json
  ```
