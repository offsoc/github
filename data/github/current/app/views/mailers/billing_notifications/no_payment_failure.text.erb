Greetings <%= @account %>,

This email is to inform you that we cannot bill your <%= @account.friendly_payment_method_name("account") %>.

There is currently no payment method on file. A payment method must be added to continue service. To update your payment information, please head to <%= @settings_url %>

<% if @help_url.present? %>
If you need a guide to updating your payment method, our handy article at <%= @help_url %> can help you out.
<% end %>

We’ll try billing your <%= @account.friendly_payment_method_name("account") %> again over the next two weeks. <%= @metered_billing_failure_text %>

If you feel there’s been a mistake or have any questions, please get in touch with us via <%= contact_url %>

Thanks,
