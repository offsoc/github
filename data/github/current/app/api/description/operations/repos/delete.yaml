summary: Delete a repository
description: |-
  Deleting a repository requires admin access.

  If an organization owner has configured the organization to prevent members from deleting organization-owned
  repositories, you will get a `403 Forbidden` response.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `delete_repo` scope to use this endpoint.
