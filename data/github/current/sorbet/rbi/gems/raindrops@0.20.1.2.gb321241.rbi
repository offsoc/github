  # Initializes a Raindrops object to hold +size+ counters.  +size+ is
  # only a hint and the actual number of counters the object has is
  # dependent on the CPU model, number of cores, and page size of
  # the machine.  The actual size of the object will always be equal
  # or greater than the specified +size+.
  # If +io+ is provided, then the Raindrops memory will be backed by
  # the specified file; otherwise, it will allocate anonymous memory.
  # The IO object must respond to +truncate+, as this is used to set
  # the size of the file.
  # If +zero+ is provided, then the memory region is zeroed prior to
  # returning. This is only meaningful if +io+ is also provided; in
  # that case it controls whether any existing counter values in +io+
  # are retained (false) or whether it is entirely zeroed (true).

# Raindrops::Middleware is Rack middleware that allows snapshotting
# current activity from an HTTP request.  For all operating systems,
# it returns at least the following fields:
#
# * calling - the number of application dispatchers on your machine
# * writing - the number of clients being written to on your machine
#
# Additional fields are available for \Linux users.
#
# It should be loaded at the top of Rack middleware stack before other
# middlewares for maximum accuracy.
#
# === Usage (Rainbows!/Unicorn preload_app=false)
#
# If you're using preload_app=false (the default) in your Rainbows!/Unicorn
# config file, you'll need to create the global Stats object before
# forking.
#
#    require 'raindrops'
#    $stats ||= Raindrops::Middleware::Stats.new
#
# In your Rack config.ru:
#
#    use Raindrops::Middleware, :stats => $stats
#
# === Usage (Rainbows!/Unicorn preload_app=true)
#
# If you're using preload_app=true in your Rainbows!/Unicorn
# config file, just add the middleware to your stack:
#
# In your Rack config.ru:
#
#    use Raindrops::Middleware
#
# === Linux-only extras!
#
# To get bound listener statistics under \Linux, you need to specify the
# listener names for your server.  You can even include listen sockets for
# *other* servers on the same machine.  This can be handy for monitoring
# your nginx proxy as well.
#
# In your Rack config.ru, just pass the :listeners argument as an array of
# strings (along with any other arguments).  You can specify any
# combination of TCP or Unix domain socket names:
#
#    use Raindrops::Middleware, :listeners => %w(0.0.0.0:80 /tmp/.sock)
#
# If you're running Unicorn 0.98.0 or later, you don't have to pass in
# the :listeners array, Raindrops will automatically detect the listeners
# used by Unicorn master process.  This does not detect listeners in
# different processes, of course.
#
# The response body includes the following stats for each listener
# (see also Raindrops::ListenStats):
#
# * active - total number of active clients on that listener
# * queued - total number of queued (pre-accept()) clients on that listener
