summary: Update an attribute for a SCIM enterprise group
description: |-
  > [!NOTE]
  > The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently in *private* beta and are subject to change.

  Update a provisioned group’s individual attributes.

  To change a group’s values, you must provide a specific Operations JSON format that contains at least one of the add, remove, or replace operations. For examples and more information on the SCIM operations format, see the [SCIM specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2).  Update can also be used to add group memberships.

  Group memberships can be sent one at a time or in batches for faster performance. **Note**: The memberships are referenced through a local user `id`, and the user will need to be created before they are referenced here.

      Update a provisioned group’s individual attributes.

      To modify a group's values, you'll need to use a specific Operations JSON format which must include at least one of the following operations: add, remove, or replace. For examples and more information on this SCIM format, consult the [SCIM specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2). The update function can also be used to add group memberships.

      You can submit group memberships individually or in batches for improved efficiency.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Memberships are referenced via a local user id. Ensure users are created before referencing them here.
