      Sets the GitHub Actions permissions policy for repositories and allowed actions in an organization.

      If the organization belongs to an enterprise that has set restrictive permissions at the enterprise level, such as `allowed_actions` to `selected` actions, then you cannot override them for the organization.

      OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
