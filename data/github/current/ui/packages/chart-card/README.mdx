## Examples

<Story />

There are many additional Storybook stories featuring different configurations of the `<ChartCard>` component. Check out the following directories in the Storybook sidebar:

- **Examples**: Stories, organized by service, demonstrating how `<ChartCard>` can be configured for exisiting use cases across github.com.
- **Props**: Kitchen sink-style stories demonstrating the effects of `<ChartCard>`’s props.
- **StressCases**: Stories that test `<ChartCard>`’s behavior under exceptional conditions. For example, a chart with thousands of data points.

## Anatomy

### Chart Header

The chart header shows contextual information about the chart and the chart’s menu.

- **Leading Visual**: An element positioned to the left of the title and description. For example, a user’s avatar. Provided using the `<ChartCard.LeadingVisual>` subcomponent. *Optional*.
- **Title**: A short and unique name for the chart. A good title can be used to identify a specific chart on a page with several. Provided using the `<ChartCard.Title>` subcomponent. *Required*.
- **Description**: Additional chart context. A good description might highlight the chart’s time period, the types of data shown, filters that are applied, the collection methodology, or who has access. Provided using the `<ChartCard.Description>` subcomponent. *Optional*.
- **Trailing Visual**: An element positioned to the left of the chart menu. For example, a counter. Provided using the `<ChartCard.TrailingVisual>` subcomponent. *Optional*.
- **Menu**: A menu of chart actions. For example, “View as table” and “Download CSV”. The menu is built in to the `<ChartCard>` component and cannot be extended using a subcomponent. However, it can be hidden with the `visibleControls` prop.

### Chart

A [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com)-powered chart, implemented using the [highcharts-react-official](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-react-official) React wrapper. Provided via the `<ChartCard.Chart>` subcomponent. *Required*.

### Data Table

A tabular representation of the chart’s data, displayed in a modal dialog. The dialog can be opened via the “View as table” option in the chart menu, or via a screen-reader-only control that appears before each chart (similar to “Skip to content” links). The data table is built in to the `<ChartCard>` component and cannot be extended using a subcomponent.

## Migrating from Charts.js

### Why migrate?

#### Accessibility

Charts throughout GitHub.com are built using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/), which uses `<canvas>`. That approach is not accessible: Elements drawn on a `<canvas>` don’t support event listeners (e.g. for keyboard events), ARIA attributes, selectable and searchable text, or styles applied with CSS.

As a result, [40+ accessibility audit issues](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/11817/views/1) have flagged keyboard, screen reader, high contrast, and zoom-related chart accessibility issues. Customers (like the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](https://github.com/github/accessibility-external/issues/25) and [Wells Fargo](https://github.com/github/accessibility-external/issues/217)) are also raising issues with the Chart.js-based charts.

#### Maintainability

The Repository Insights team wrote about their experience migrating from Chart.js (and custom `d3`-based charting) in [“Staff Ship: Rewriting Repository Insights for Accessibility” (github/repos#11329)](https://github.com/github/repos/discussions/11329). The table below is copied from that discussion:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th style={{textAlign:"left"}}>Page</th><th style={{textAlign:"right"}}>Old LOC</th><th style={{textAlign:"right"}}>New LOC</th><th style={{textAlign:"right"}}>% smaller</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td style={{textAlign:"left"}}>Contributors</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>713</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>486</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>68%</td></tr>
    <tr><td style={{textAlign:"left"}}>Code frequency</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>248</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>175</td><td style={{textAlign:"right"}}>70%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

By migrating to `<ChartCard>`, the Repository Insights team eliminated about 30% of the code for the Contributors and Code Frequency pages. That means a Hubber new to the codebase has 30% less to learn, and so can be productive 30% faster. Even if those lines just moved into `<ChartCard>` itself, it’s still a maintainability win: Because `<ChartCard>` is a shared component, every team doesn’t have to reinvent the wheel. Every team will share and benefit from accessibility, security, and performance improvements contributed by others.

Leveraging `<ChartCard>` meant the team could avoid making changes to the previous charts’ “logic and rendering [that] is all bespoke”, including a “~600 line file full of 2d math and web component syntax”. In contrast, Highcharts is a widely-used charting library. Highcharts has extensive documentation and online discussions. New Hubbers may join with experience using Highcharts, experience that translates to `<ChartCard.Chart>`, whose API is a superset of Highcharts’.

### How long does it take to migrate?

Also in [“Staff Ship: Rewriting Repository Insights for Accessibility” (github/repos#11329)](https://github.com/github/repos/discussions/11329), @ansballard describes an “accurate portrayal of an average implementation” that he took “from start to mvp in an hour or two, with minimal follow up work.”

Transforming data has been the most time-consuming step, in the migrations that have been completed so far.

### What to migrate?

[Charts Accessibility Audit / Checklist (“Updated audit 2024” sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10CtzH9dhdFYEM28FeHEeNmC8icki-iMP7bUH8-N5aeE/edit#gid=2039645249) lists 15 charts across GitHub.com today. 10 are definite candidates for migration.

### How to migrate?

The “Examples” directory (in the Storybook sidebar) contains stories, organized by service, demonstrating how `<ChartCard>` can be configured for exisiting use cases across github.com.

For the most part, the props passed to `ChartCard.Chart` are syntactic sugar for Highcharts options. Refer to the [Highcharts API documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) for comprehensive information on what can be configured.

The Highcharts API is a superset of the `ChartCard.Chart` API, so you can always fall back to Highcharts options if you need to do something that `ChartCard.Chart` doesn’t support via `overrideOptionsNotRecommended`.

When implementing your chart, be sure to address the following:
- color contrast, if changing from default (see [“Configuring chart colors”](#configuring-chart-colors) below), meets 4.5:1 requirement according to [WCAG SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum)
- reflow does not introduce horizontal scroll at 320px viewport width, 200% zoom, in accordance with [WCAG SC 1.4.10: Reflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow)

## Usage

### Choosing a title and description

- A good title can be used to identify a specific chart on a page with several.
- A good description might highlight the chart’s time period, the types of data shown, filters that are applied, the collection methodology, or who has access.

### Configuring chart colors

By default, ChartCard uses the [Highcharts accent colors defined in @primer/primitives](https://primer.style/primitives/storybook/?path=/story/color-datavis--highcharts-accent-colors).

Depending on your design, you may wish to change these colors or to choose based on semantic meaning. For example, a chart showing “open” and “closed” issues might use green and purple, respectively. When this is the case, use color variables from @primer/primitives, and ensure that color contrast of any overlapping elements meets [WCAG SC 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum).

### Configuring line styles and symbols

[WCAG SC 1.4.1: Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#use-of-color) requires that:

> Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

Highcharts (and `<ChartCard.Chart>`) supports patterned fills, dotted/dashed lines, and various marker shapes. As noted in [WCAG Technique G111: Using color and pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G111.html), this is a sufficient technique to meet SC 1.4.1:

> **Example 1**
> A real estate site provides a bar chart of average housing prices in several regions of the United States. The bar for each region is displayed with a different solid color and a different pattern. The legend uses the same colors and patterns to identify each bar.

Depending on chart scale and data density, different approaches are preferred:

- If a line chart’s point markers are close enough together, that they appear to form a thick line instead of a series of points along a line, then a user won’t be able to rely on marker shape to distinguish series. In this case, it’s better to hide markers and use different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) to distinguish series.

- Highcharts supports 11 line styles. If a line chart contains more than 11 series, then it’s better to show markers and use different marker shapes to distinguish series, so a line style isn’t used twice (for different series) in the same chart.

### Configuring axis title visibility

Axis titles are rendered by default, but can be hidden if they're redundant. For example, "Time" is often redundant with a chart's x-axis labels. If the title indicates what the y axis is measuring, then it can be hidden as well.

If multiple axes are rendered in a chart, then both titles should be visible, to avoid ambiguity.

Refer to the examples in the Storybook sidebar for guidance on configuring axis titles.
