# Overview

This section outlines accessibility considerations including terminology, keyboard support, error handling, and DOM markup.

## Terminology

Following are definitions of terms used in this document:

### `uuid` / Universally Unique Identifier

This is a placeholder for a unique string prefixed onto an element's `id` value. The `uuid` prefix value should be the same for each instance within a component.

For example, a UUID for a component could be `a0242ac120003`. This string is then used as a prefix for the following ids:

* `a0242ac120003-wrapper`
* `a0242ac120003-title`
* `a0242ac120003-subtitle`
* etc.

The UUID prevents collisions that would break or confuse assistive technology if more than one instance of the component is used on a page or view. The [React useId hook](https://github.com/primer/react/blob/5bd258073958f0c1852041e238adc11dd6ebfcfd/src/hooks/useId.ts) can be used to accomplish this.

## Keyboard support

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Key</td>
      <td>Function</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <kbd>Tab</kbd>
      </td>
      <td>
        Navigate through interactive Simple ListItem content. Focus order is managed by the browser, and follows DOM order.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Organization

A Simple ListView's content organization is author-supplied. It can be alphabetical, numerical, arbitrary order, or any other other that the author requires.

## Focus management

The Simple ListView component **does not** use custom focus management. Focus order is managed by the browser, and follows DOM order.

Simple ListView secondary actions may use subcomponents that manage focus. Focus management for these subcomponents is handled by the subcomponent.

## Error states

The Simple ListView component itself supports two forms of error states for its content and also four error states for more general error conditions.

### Error states for Simple ListView content

The following are error states for Simple ListView content. Also reference [error validation guidance](?path=/docs/recipes-simplelistview-documentation-accessibility-error-validation--docs).

#### When individual Simple ListView ListItems have validation errors for their content

In this scenario, the input subcomponents used for ListItem secondary actions contain validation errors, but these errors are not part of a larger data-collection experience.

Validation and focus state is controlled by the subcomponent, and the Simple ListView component instance does not manage the validation state of its child elements.

An example of this would be a secondary action that requires a valid phone number, but the user enters incorrect information.

#### When there are one or more individual Simple ListView ListItem validation errors that contribute to a larger data-collection experience

In this scenario the data-collection experience can be a form scoped to the Simple ListView component instance itself, or a larger experience that contains or or more Simple ListView components.

Validation and focus state is controlled both by subcompoents own internal validation logic, and also a larger error summary that is managed by the overall form.

An example of this is a view where a Simple ListView component instance is part of a larger configuration experience. The overall experience uses a save button that includes both the Simple ListView instance and other inputs.

### Error states for general error conditions

There are four likely error conditions for a Nested Simple component:

1. The Simple ListView content cannot be successfully loaded.
2. A user needs to reauthenticate.
3. A user has no connection.
4. A generic, catchall error when the error type cannot be determined.

An error-triggering event uses [the Dialog component](https://primer.style/react/Dialog) to communicate the accompanying error message. Other error conditions not identified in this documentation can utilize the dialog to inform users of the error, as well.
