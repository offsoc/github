summary: List SCIM provisioned identities for an enterprise
description: |-
  > [!NOTE]
  > The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently in *private* beta and are subject to change.

  Lists provisioned SCIM enterprise members.

  When a user with a SCIM-provisioned external identity is removed from an enterprise through a `patch` with `active` flag set to `false`, the account's metadata is preserved to allow the user to re-join the enterprise in the future. However, the user's account will be suspended and the user will not be able to sign-in. In order to permanently suspend the users account with no ability to re-join the enterprise in the future, use the `delete` request. Users that were not permanently deleted will be visible in the returned results.

      Lists provisioned SCIM enterprise members.

      When you remove a user with a SCIM-provisioned external identity from an enterprise using a `patch` with `active` flag to `false`, the user's metadata remains intact. This means they can potentially re-join the enterprise later. Although, while suspended, the user can't sign in. If you want to ensure the user can't re-join in the future, use the delete request. Only users who weren't permanently deleted will appear in the result list.
