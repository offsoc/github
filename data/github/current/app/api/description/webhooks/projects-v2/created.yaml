summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to an organization-level project. For more information, see "[About Projects](${externalDocsUrl}/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)." For information about the Projects API, see [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#projectv2).

  For activity relating to a item on a project, use the `projects_v2_item` event. For activity relating to Projects (classic), use the `project`, `project_card`, and `project_column` events instead.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Projects" organization permission.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Webhook events for projects are currently in beta and subject to change. To share feedback about projects webhooks with GitHub, see the [Projects webhook feedback discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/17405).
