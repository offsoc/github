# Differences from QueryBuilder?

While the [QueryBuilder](?path=/docs/recipes-querybuilder-readme--docs) and [Filter](?path=/docs/recipes-filter-readme--docs) might look similar at first glance, there are several key differences. This document details various features that are either absent in the [QueryBuilder](?path=/docs/recipes-querybuilder-readme--docs) or have been modified to provide a more consistent experience.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Filter features

### Advanced filter dialog

Enables users to create complex queries through a user-friendly visual interface. This feature is an excellent tool for learning the syntax and constructing queries without the need to constantly refer to our documentation.

![The user interface of the advanced filters dialog with various criteria set. Filters include Author, Organization, Comments, Created date and Text. The bottom of the window has a "Add filter" button to add more filters,  a "Cancel" button and a "Show 20 results" to confirm your filters.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/62e5a8ab-4e80-4852-99e2-2471f5ed7ea6)

### Comma separated values

Merge multiple values using commas to create `OR` logic. For instance, using `label:bug,enhancement` will find issues tagged with either `bug` or `enhancement`.

![A filter input with a query being typed in. The query is "label:feature," which suggests that the user is searching for items labeled as "feature". Below the search bar are a four suggestions shown including: "bug" with a red dot and described as "Something isn't working", "chore" with a blue dot, "communities-of-practice" with a green dot and "dependencies" with an orange dot and described as "Pull requests that update a dependency file".](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/a819c63c-367f-4ac0-a43f-d5492ad606ae)

### Validation

Queries are validated and warning messages appear if there are syntax errors. This feature helps users understand when their query is invalid and, where possible, how to fix it.

![The filter input has a query set to "is:open comments:>10 abc". A warning message below the input indicates a problem with one of the filters, suggesting that "is:open" might be incorrect and proposing "state:open" as a possible correction.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/79a8ad43-8e2b-4ac2-9849-d0d16b387e4d)

**Note**: Validation warnings will not block users from submitting queries. It will only show a warning message to help guide them.

### Migration (soon)

To achieve a consistent filter syntax across various features, we must gradually migrate certain filters. This deliberate pace allows our users ample time to adjust. This component is designed to assist teams in executing this transition in the most effective way possible.
The progress on this feature can be tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/github/memex/issues/16930).

![A dialog titled "Update deprecated filters" informs the user that some filters have been deprecated and will be removed in the future. The window lists the deprecated filters with their replacements: "is:open" should be updated to "state:open", "no:assignee" to "assignee:none", and "no:label" to "label:none". There are buttons at the bottom for canceling or updating to the new filter terms.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/b15a67e5-ebfb-4623-a882-457fc0f1ea4c)

### Mobile

The QueryBuilder operates smoothly on mobile devices, but using only an input field for filtering can be challenging. To enhance the mobile experience, the advanced filter dialog is specially tailored for smaller screens, ensuring a convenient and efficient filtering process on mobile devices.

![The image shows an advanced filters dialog box with two filters set. The first filter is for "Author" with the operator "is one of" and a value that appears to be a group of "5 people". The second filter is for "Language" with the same operator "is one of" and the same group value of "5 people". There are options to add more filters at the bottom and buttons to cancel or show 20 results. Each filter has a close button indicated by an "x".](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/2752d2b4-359a-4fed-8b01-77b365d0af24)

### Dynamic values

Dynamic values such as `@me`, `@today`, etc., are displayed distinctively compared to static values, creating a clear visual differentiation.

![The image features a filter input with the query "created:@today" to filter results by items created today. Next to it, another filter input with a a ‚Äúcreated:‚Äù and is showing suggestions such as "Today," "Yesterday," "This week," "Last week," a specific date "Aug 10, 2023," and an option for a "Custom date..." There's also a suggestion "Exclude" to omit selected dates from the search results.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/003b26b9-310b-4db9-81e8-0d9e1dc1affd)

## ü§ì Code

Although it appears similar, this component doesn't utilize the [QueryBuilder element](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/query-builder-element/README.md) as the [QueryBuilder React wrapper](?path=/docs/recipes-querybuilder-readme--docs) does. Instead, it relies entirely on React.
