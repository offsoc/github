summary: Create a discussion
description: |-
  Creates a new discussion post on a team's page.

  This endpoint triggers [notifications](${externalDocsUrl}/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Best practices for using the REST API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/discussions`.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `write:discussion` scope to use this endpoint.
