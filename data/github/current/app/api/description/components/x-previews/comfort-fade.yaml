  Multi-line comments in a pull request diff is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, these response fields may change without advance notice. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-10-03-multi-line-comments) for more information.

  To create multi-line comments or see multi-line comments with the new supported fields during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.comfort-fade-preview+json
  ```

  To show multi-line comment-supported fields in the response, use the `comfort-fade` preview header and the `line` parameter.

  If you use the `comfort-fade` preview header, your response will show:

  *   For multi-line comments, values for `start_line`, `original_start_line`, `start_side`, `line`, `original_line`, and `side`.
  *   For single-line comments, values for `line`, `original_line`, and `side` and a `null` value for `start_line`, `original_start_line`, and `start_side`.

  If you don't use the `comfort-fade` preview header, multi-line and single-line comments will appear the same way in the response with a single `position` attribute. Your response will show:

  *   For multi-line comments, the last line of the comment range for the `position` attribute.
  *   For single-line comments, the diff-positioned way of referencing comments for the `position` attribute.
