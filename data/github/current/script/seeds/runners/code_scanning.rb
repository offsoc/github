        Create a repo with seeded alerts for code scanning development

        - by default creates new repo (or creates/updates named one)
        - opens PR from branch into main

        Requires turboscan (turbomock is not sufficient). See docs:
        https://github.com/github/code-scanning/blob/main/docs/running-your-own-instance.md#codespaces-all-the-things-recommended-if-modifying-turboscan
