Hello,

Thank you for being a part of GitHub for Startups!

We're reaching out because your program expiration is coming up on <%= @expiration_date %>.

Would you like to continue on GitHub Enterprise?

To ensure your Enterprise plan is not interrupted, please notify us with your intent to continue on GitHub Enterprise at least 5 business days before your program expiration.

Once confirmed, we'll send over next steps and convert your current Enterprise Account to a self-serve Enterprise Account - you will not experience any interruptions during the conversion process.
Once complete, you'll be able to manage licenses directly in your Enterprise. Enterprise seats are $21 per user per month.

If we don't hear from you, your organization will automatically be downgraded to a Free plan on your termination date,
and your Enterprise Account will be deleted. You will be notified once your organization has been removed from the Enterprise,
at which time you may self-serve upgrade to the Team tier.

Thank you again for building with GitHub for Startups! Please let us know if you have any questions.

The GitHub for Startups Team
