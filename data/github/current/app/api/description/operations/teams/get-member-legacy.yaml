summary: Get team member (Legacy)
description: |-
  The "Get team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.

  We recommend using the [Get team membership for a user](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/members#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint instead. It allows you to get both active and pending memberships.

  To list members in a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.
