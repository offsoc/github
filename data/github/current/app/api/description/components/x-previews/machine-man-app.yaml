  If an issue event is created via a GitHub App, the response will include the `performed_via_github_app` object with	information about the GitHub App. For more information, see the [related blog	post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-09-14-Integrations-Early-Access).
  To receive the `performed_via_github_app` object in the response, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.machine-man-preview
  ```
