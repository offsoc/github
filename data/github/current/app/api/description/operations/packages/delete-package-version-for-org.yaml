summary: Delete package version for an organization
description: |-
  Deletes a specific package version in an organization. If the package is public and the package version has more than 5,000 downloads, you cannot delete the package version. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.

  The authenticated user must have admin permissions in the organization to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, the authenticated user must also have admin permissions to the package. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
