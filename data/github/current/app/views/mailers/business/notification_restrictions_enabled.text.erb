The <%= @business.name %> enterprise has restricted notifications to domain emails.

Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

The following organizations now require a verified email from one of the listed domains in order to receive notifications from repositories owned by the organization:

<% @org_domains.each do |organization, domains| %>
  <%= organization.display_login %>:
  <% domains.each do |domain| %>
    - <%= domain %>
  <% end %>
  <% @enterprise_domains.each do |domain| %>
    - <%= domain %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

If you would like to continue receiving email notifications for these organizations, you must add a verified email from one of the verified or approved
domains for each organization. You can add email addresses in your email settings:

<%= settings_email_preferences_url %>
