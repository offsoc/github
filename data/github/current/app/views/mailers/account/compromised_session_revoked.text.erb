Hello <%= @user.display_login %>,

GitHub security research has determined that your account security is endangered because your account's authentication data was shared in a dump or list that is available to criminal actors.

To protect your account, we've logged you out of your current session. To keep your account secure you will be required to change your password before you can continue to use GitHub.

Please visit <%= password_reset_url %> to reset the password for your GitHub account.

If you have already changed your password, no further action is required.

For more information on creating a strong password, visit <%= GitHub.help_url %>/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-strong-password

This exposure was not the result of a compromise of GitHub. Authentication data exposure can be caused by one or more factors, including:

- Use of a password that has been shared in credential dumps or brute-forcing lists.
- Use of a malicious browser extension that can steal data from your browser.
- A malware infection that can steal data from your browser or computer.

If you would like to check your device for potential malware, you may refer to the resources included below on preventing, identifying, and mitigating malware:
