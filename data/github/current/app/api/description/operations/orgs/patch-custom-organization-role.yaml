summary: 'Update a custom organization role'
description: |-
  Updates an existing custom organization role. Permission changes will apply to all assignees. For more information on custom organization roles, see "[Managing people's access to your organization with roles](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-organization-roles)."

  If the update would add repository permissions, the `base_role` must also be set to a value besides `none`, either
  previously or as part of the update.
  If the update sets the `base_role` field to `none`, you must also remove all of the repository
  permissions as well, otherwise the update will fail.

  To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must be one of:

  - An administrator for the organization.
  - A user, or a user on a team, with the fine-grained permissions of `write_organization_custom_org_role` in the organization.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
