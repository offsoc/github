Greetings <%= @account %>,

We’ve attempted to bill your <%= @account.friendly_payment_method_name("account") %>, but have been unsuccessful. The following is the response we received when trying to bill your account:

<%= @message %>

Your past due subscriptions have been cancelled, and access to metered usage has been restricted.

To restore access, please update your payment information. You will also need to re-subscribe to any cancelled products.
If you have no remaining paid products, we may remove your payment method to ensure continued access to free features.

To update your payment method, please visit <%= @settings_url %>

<% if @help_url.present? %>
If you need a guide to updating your payment method, our handy article at <%= @help_url %> can help you out.
