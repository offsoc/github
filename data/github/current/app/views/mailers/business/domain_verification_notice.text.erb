Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

An owner of the <%= @business.safe_profile_name %> enterprise account just <%= @state %> the <%= @verified_domain %> domain.

You are a member of the following organizations within the <%= @business.safe_profile_name %> enterprise:
<% @organization_logins.each do |display_login| %>
  <%= display_login %>
<% end %>

Previously, admins of these organizations could see:

• If you have two-factor authentication enabled or not
• Your public profile information
• Certain activity within this organization
• Country of request origin
• Your access level to repositories within the organization
• Your IP address

Now, admins will also be able to see:

• Your email address in the <%= @verified_domain %> domain.
