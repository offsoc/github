      Hey <%= @user.display_login %>!
    </p>

    <p>
      You just added a passkey to your account from your "<%= @useragent_nickname %>" device.
    </p>

    <% if @two_factor_enabled %>
      <p>
        In case you lose access to your passkey or two-factor credentials,
        please take a moment to <a href="<%= settings_auth_recovery_codes_url %>">download your recovery codes</a>.
        Without valid credentials or recovery codes, you risk being locked out of your account<% unless GitHub.enterprise? %>, and GitHub Support will not be able to restore your access<% end %>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To remove your passkey, visit <a href="<%= settings_security_url %>">your account security settings</a>.
      </p>
    <% else %>
      <p>
        Because you can still authenticate with your password, we recommend that you also <a href="<%= settings_security_url %>">enable two-factor authentication</a>.

    <p>
      If you did not initiate this action or believe your account has been compromised, it is a good idea to review
      your active sessions and all passkeys associated with your account or consider enabling two-factor authentication.
