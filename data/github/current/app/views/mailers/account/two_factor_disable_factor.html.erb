  Hey <%= @user.display_login %>!
</p>

<% if @updated_fallback %>
  <p>
    Your fallback SMS number has been updated to become your primary two-factor <%= @factor_display_name %> registration on your account.
    This is because you had a fallback SMS number configured as well as a primary SMS number. Fallback SMS numbers are no longer supported.
    You can also read about this change in <%= link_to "this blog post", "#{GitHub.blog_url}/changelog/2023-03-02-sms-and-totp-can-now-both-be-registered-2fa-methods/" =%>.
  </p>
<% else %>
  <p>
    Your two-factor <%= @factor_display_name %> registration on your account has been removed.
  </p>
<% end %>

<p>
  <b>Your recovery codes have not been updated</b>, but you should ensure they are saved to a safe place.
</p>

<p>
  Recovery codes are the only way to access your account again. By saving your
  recovery codes, youâ€™ll be able to regain access if you:
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Lose your phone</li>
    <li>Delete your authenticator application</li>
    <li>Change your phone number</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<% unless GitHub.enterprise? %>
<p>
  GitHub Support will not be able to restore access to your account.
</p>
