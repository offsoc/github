summary: Update an import
description: |-
  An import can be updated with credentials or a project choice by passing in the appropriate parameters in this API
  request. If no parameters are provided, the import will be restarted.

  Some servers (e.g. TFS servers) can have several projects at a single URL. In those cases the import progress will
  have the status `detection_found_multiple` and the Import Progress response will include a `project_choices` array.
  You can select the project to import by providing one of the objects in the `project_choices` array in the update request.

  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** Due to very low levels of usage and available alternatives, this endpoint is deprecated and will no longer be available from 00:00 UTC on April 12, 2024. For more details and alternatives, see the [changelog](https://gh.io/source-imports-api-deprecation).
