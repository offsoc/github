The list below is a sequence of telemetry events produced by codespace during various failed web client connections.
$KUSTO_CSV$
The csv above has 5 columns: LoadId, Timestamp, Action, Progress, and Result. The first one is an id that identifies a single user session, the second one is just the time of the event, the second one is
the action that is being performed, the third one is the progress step of said action, and the fourth one is the result of the action which will only
be present for the end of said action. So a single action could include multiple progress steps and only one result.
A single session is wrapped by a "Load" Action with the Progress "Start" and a "Load" Action with the Progress "Stop", and identified by a unique "LoadId"
There could be multiple "Load" sessions in the table above and each session can have multiple events and progress in between the start and stop of the "Load" Action,
but once the "Load" Action with the Progress "Stop" is reached, the session is considered finished, so we can ignore the events and progress that are not chronologicaly between a "Load" Action with the Progress "Start" and a "Load" Action with the Progress "Stop".
The following is a CSV with the description of the progress steps.
$DESCRIPTION_CSV$
The csv above has 2 columns: Progress, and Description. The first one is the progress step, and the second one is the description of said step.
Given the failed sessions found and the progress descriptions given, enlist each session by time and give a short summary on what caused the client connection to fail for each session
