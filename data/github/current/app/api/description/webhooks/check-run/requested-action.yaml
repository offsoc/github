summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a check run. For information about check runs, see "[Getting started with the Checks API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api)." For information about the APIs to manage check runs, see [the GraphQL API documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#checkrun) or "[Check Runs](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/checks/runs)" in the REST API documentation.

  For activity relating to check suites, use the `check-suite` event.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Checks" repository permission. To receive the `rerequested` and `requested_action` event types, the app must have at least write-level access for the "Checks" permission. GitHub Apps with write-level access for the "Checks" permission are automatically subscribed to this webhook event.

  Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for the `created` and `completed` event types in repositories.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check run was created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.
description: |-
  A check run completed, and someone requested a followup action that your app provides. Only the GitHub App someone requests to perform an action will receive the `requested_action` payload. For more information, see "[Creating CI tests with the Checks API](${externalDocsUrl}/developers/apps/guides/creating-ci-tests-with-the-checks-api)."
