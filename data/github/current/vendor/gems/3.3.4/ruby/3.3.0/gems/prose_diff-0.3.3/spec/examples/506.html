      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>

      <p>Pan Dan Chee looked at me. &#8220;What,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;could that have been?&#8221;</p>

      <p>*It sounded very much like a laugh to me,* I replied.</p>

      <p>Pan Dan Chee nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;but how can there be a laugh
      where there is no one to laugh?&#8221; Pan Dan Chee was perplexed.</p>

      <p>*Perhaps the ulsios of Horz have learned to laugh,* I suggested with a
      smile.</p>
  
      <h3>Pan Dan Chee Ignores Me</h3>

      <p>Pan Dan Chee ignored my flippancy. &#8220;We saw a light and we heard a
      laugh,&#8221; he said thoughtfully. &#8220;What does that convey to you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;The same thing that it conveys to you,&#8221; I said: &#8220;that there is some
      one down here in the pits of Horz beside us.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do not see how that can be possible,&#8221; he said.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s investigate,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

      <p>With drawn swords we advanced; for we did not know the nature nor the
      temper of the owner of that laugh, and there was always the chance that
      an ulsio might leap from one of the dungeons and attack us.</p>
