      If the commit is not present in the default branch, additionally returns open pull
      requests associated with the commit. The results may include open and closed pull
      requests. Additional preview headers may be required to see certain details for
      associated pull requests, such as whether a pull request is in a draft state. For
      more information about previews that might affect this endpoint, see the [List pull
      requests](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests) endpoint.
