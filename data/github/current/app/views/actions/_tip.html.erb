      This is your repositoryâ€™s "Actions" tab, where you can find the jobs most recently run by
      your workflows. Your demo-repository includes the <a class="Link--inTextBlock" href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/proof-html" target="_blank">Proof HTML</a>
      workflow, which allows developers to continuously integrate new code while automatically checking for invalid HTML.

      The <strong>proof-html.yml</strong> workflow in your repository is currently configured to run automatically whenever someone pushes code,
      or to run manually; which you can do from this page. Just select <strong>Run workflow</strong> below to see it in action.
