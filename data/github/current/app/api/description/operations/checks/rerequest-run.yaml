summary: Rerequest a check run
description: |-
  Triggers GitHub to rerequest an existing check run, without pushing new code to a repository. This endpoint will trigger the [`check_run` webhook](${externalDocsUrl}/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_run) event with the action `rerequested`. When a check run is `rerequested`, its `status` is reset to `queued` and the `conclusion` is cleared.

  For more information about how to re-run GitHub Actions jobs, see "[Re-run a job from a workflow run](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/actions/workflow-runs#re-run-a-job-from-a-workflow-run)".

  OAuth apps and personal access tokens (classic) cannot use this endpoint.
