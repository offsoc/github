  New endpoints using OAuth tokens as input parameters instead of path parameters are available for developers to preview in the [OAuth Applications API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/apps/oauth-applications). To access these endpoints during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.doctor-strange-preview+json
  ```
