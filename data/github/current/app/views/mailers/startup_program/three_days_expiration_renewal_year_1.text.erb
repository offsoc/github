Hello,

We're following up as your access to GitHub for Startups expires in 3 days.

Would you like to take advantage of the 50% discount for your second year in the program?

If so, we kindly ask that you please confirm if you'd like to continue on GitHub Enterprise and the GitHub for Startups partner (https://github.com/enterprise/startups/partners) you're associated with so that we can send over a quote and next steps.

If not, no worries. Once your termination is processed, you'll be notified when your organization(s) are removed from your Enterprise Account and downgraded to a Free plan.
Once that takes place, you'll have the ability to remain on the free tier or self-serve purchase the Team plan. If you receive an invoice for any consumptive add-ons, you will still be able to pay in the admin dashboard.

Thanks again for having been a part of GitHub for Startups!

Regards,

The GitHub for Startups Team
