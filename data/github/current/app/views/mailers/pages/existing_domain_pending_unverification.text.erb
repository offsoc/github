Another account on the platform has a verified <%= @domain.name %> which you use for one of your GitHub Pages sites. Please verify your domain within 7 days by following our instructions before it becomes unverified. See <%= @protected_domain_url %>.

When a domain is unverified, other users can freely publish GitHub Pages sites on that domain. Additionally, since another user has verified this domain, your GitHub Pages sites on that domain will move back to github.io.

Manage your verified domains at <%= @pages_settings_url %>.
