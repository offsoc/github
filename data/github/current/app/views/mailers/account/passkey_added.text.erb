Hey <%= @user.display_login %>!

You just added a passkey to your account from your "<%= @useragent_nickname %>" device.

<% if @two_factor_enabled %>
In case you lose access to your passkey or two-factor credentials,
please take a moment to download your recovery codes at:

<%= settings_auth_recovery_codes_url %>

Without valid credentials or recovery codes, you risk being locked out of your account<% unless GitHub.enterprise? %>, and GitHub support will not be able to restore your access<% end %>.

To disable two-factor authentication or remove your passkey, visit
<%= settings_security_url %>

<% else %>
Because you can still authenticate with your password, we recommend also enabling two-factor authentication.

To enable two-factor authentication, visit <%= settings_security_url %>

<% end %>
More information about two-factor authentication can be found on GitHub Help at
<%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/about-two-factor-authentication

To see this and other security events for your account, visit <%= settings_user_audit_log_url %>

If you did not initiate this action or believe your account has been compromised, it is a good idea to review
your active sessions and all passkeys associated with your account or consider enabling two-factor authentication.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
