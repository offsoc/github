## ListView

### Container

This subcomponent is **required**.

A ListView needs a container that can express the boundaries of its content. This container communicates the boundary area that the ListView UI is placed in.

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView internals -->
</div>
```

#### Container title

This is **required**.

A title provides the ListView with a concise, descriptive name that communicates what kind of content it contains.

The container title uses a heading element that is visually hidden. The heading serves three purposes. It:

1. Allows users to understand quickly understand the ListView instance overall purpose, as well as anticipate what kind of content they can expect to find within it.
2. Serves as a reference internally within the different parts of the ListView construct, to provide a way for users to understand what ListView controls apply to and affect what ListView construct.

* This is especially helpful in circumstances where more than one ListView component is used on the same page or view.

3. Provides a way for assistive technology users to quickly and easily navigate to each ListView instance.

#### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <hX id="uuid-list-view-container-title" class="sr-only"> {title} </hX>
  <ul aria-labelledby="uuid-list-view-container-title" tabindex="-1" role="list">
    <!-- ListView internals -->
  </ul>
</div>
```

* The `X` in the `hX` element is a placeholder used to indicate the heading level.
  * The heading's level should be adjustable by the component author.
  * The heading level in most circumstances should should increment by 1 based on the heading level placed before it in the DOM.
  * For example, the heading used for the ListView's container title should be a `h2` if the previous heading is a `h1`.
* A class of [`sr-only`](https://primer.style/css/utilities/layout#screen-reader-only) is applied to the heading element.
  * This visually hides the heading, but ensures it is discoverable for screen readers for use as a navigational aid.
* The `title` in the heading element is a placeholder for a component author-supplied string.
  * The title should concisely describe the ListView's contents.
* An `id` with a UUID prefix is added to the heading element used container title.
  * This declaration will be used to reference and construct accessible names for content nested within the ListView.
  * The suffix of `-list-view-container-title` is a suggestion for a potential naming scheme and not a requirement.
* An `aria-labelledby` attribute is applied to the `ul` element immediately following the heading element.
  * `aria-labelledby`'s value is set to the `id` value used for the heading element.
  * The other `ul` element declarations are included for completeness' sake, but will be explained in a later section.

### Metadata container

This is **optional**.

The metadata container provides an area for content such as status and selection of Open and Closed Issues, list sorting criteria, display density toggling, and other bulk-level actions. Use the `ListView.Metadata` React component.

#### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* The metadata container uses a `div` element.
* An `id` with a UUID prefix is added to the `div`.
  * This declaration will be used to reference and construct accessible names.
  * The suffix of `-list-view-metadata` is a suggestion for a potential naming scheme and not a requirement.

![4 different variants of the ListViewHeader, selectable and non-selectable variants as well as the section filters variant showing Open and Closed as entry points to filter the contents](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4548309/227480117-a46dc13f-9cf3-4776-8a14-e850e57a6c49.png)

#### `ListView.Metadata` attributes

<ArgTypes of={ListViewMetadata} />

**Structure**

```jsx
<ListView
  title="Issues list"
  titleHeaderLevel={2}
  metadata={
    <ListView.Metadata title="Issues" densityToggle={<ListViewDensityToggle />}>
      <SortingOptionsMenu />
    </ListView.Metadata>
  }
>
  {...}
</ListView>
```

### Metadata content and bulk actions

Metadata content and bulk actions are **optional**, but the metadata container is **required** if content and bulk actions are used.

Subcomponents added to the metadata container are mutually independentâ€”each subcomponent can be added individually and does not require other subcomponents to function.

This subsection does not contain an exhaustive list of all metadata content and bulk action subcomponents. Following is guidance for common ListView content and bulk actions to serve as a guide for how other content can be incorporated. The list of documented metadata content and bulk actions is:

1. [Select all ListView list items.](#1-select-all-list-view-list-items)
2. [Categorical computed section filters selection and status.](#2-categorical-computed-section-filters-selection-and-status)
3. [ListView sorting status.](#3-list-view-sorting-status)
4. [Display density toggle.](#4-display-density-toggle)
5. [Additional actions.](#5-additional-actions)
6. [Persist density selection.](#6-persist-density-selection)

#### 1. Select all ListView list items

This subcomponent allows a user to select all list items within a ListView. It can be used **only** if the ListView supports individual list item selection capability.

The following is guidance for general selection behavior, as well as pagination considerations:

##### General behavior

If a ListView supports list item selection functionality, a select all subcomponent can be added to the [metadata container](#metadata-container), provided the metadata container is used in the ListView construct.

If the select all subcomponent is used, it **must** be placed as the first child element in the ListView metadata container.

Activating the "Select all list items" checkbox `input` will place <strong>all</strong> ListView list items in a selected state. The "Select all list items" `input` is placed in a checked state, and the checkbox `input` associated with each associated ListView list item is also placed in a checked state.

The "Select all list items" checkbox `input` is also placed in a checked state if all ListView list items are selected on a ListView instance.

Activating the "Select all list items" checkbox `input` if it is in a checked state will cause it to be placed in an unchecked state. All associated ListView list items are also placed in an unchecked state.

If all ListView list items are selected, deselecting one or more ListView list items will place the "Select all list items" checkbox `input` in [an indeterminate state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#checkbox-state-\(type=checkbox\)). The "Select all list items" checkbox `input` is also placed in an indeterminate state if one or more ListView list items are placed in a selected state.

A total count of selected list items is also included. This count is conditionally visually displayed

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <div>
      <input id="uuid-list-view-select-all" type="checkbox" />
      <label for="uuid-list-view-select-all" class="sr-only"> Select all {list items}: {title} </label>
      <p class="sr-only">
        <span aria-hidden="true">0 {list items} selected</span>
        <span>0 {list items} selected</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* The outermost `div` is used for positioning and styling purposes.
* The `div` contains a checkbox `input` with a visually hidden `label` element.
  * The `label` element provides the accessible name for the checkbox `input`, and uses the string, "Select all `list items`: `title`"
  * `list items` is the fallback term if an author does not specify an alternative.
    * If author-supplied, the term **must** concisely and accurately describe what ListItem content a user can select (ex: "issues").
  * `title` is a placeholder for the [container title](#container-title).
  * The `label` element has a `for` attribute, whose value matches the `id` value assigned to the following checkbox `input`.
  * The checkbox `input` has an `id` assigned to it whose value is used to create the programmatic association between the `label` element and this `input` element.
  * The `label` is visually hidden using a declaration of `class="sr-only"`, using [Primer's Screen reader only class](https://primer.style/design/foundations/css-utilities/layout#screen-reader-only).
* The `p` element is used to contain a summary of how many list items are selected.
  * The `p` element is **initially** visually hidden using a declaration of `class="sr-only"`
  * Within the `p` element are two strings contained within `span` elements:
    1. The first `span` has `aria-hidden="true"` declared on it to hide its presence from assistive technology. This `span` construct will eventually be visually displayed to a user once one or more list item selection events occur.
    2. The second `span` provides more detail about what is not currently selected. These two `span` elements work together to visually preserve the design, but also provide sufficient context for what specifically is being selected.
  * Additional behavior for the selected list item summary follows:

##### Selected list item summary behavior

When **one or more** list items in a ListView are selected the following behavior occurs:

* The `sr-only` class is removed from the `p` element that contains the two `span` elements.
* A `sr-only` class is declared on the second `span` element, the one that contains the "0 list items selected" string.
* The number `0` in the two strings ("0 selected" and "0 list items selected") is updated to match the number of list items selected.
  * Subsequent list item selections made by the user update the number to reflect the total number of rows selected.
  * Subsequent list item deselection made by the user also updates the number to reflect the total number of rows selected.
  * ListItems **cannot** be partially selected or deselected in such a way that the number of deselected list items is greater than the total number of list items. Totals such as `1.5` or `-3` are disallowed.
* If **one or more, but not all** list items are placed in a selected state, the checkbox `input` is placed in [an indeterminate state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#checkbox-state-\(type=checkbox\)).
  * Activating the checkbox `input` if it is placed in an indeterminate state will deselect **all** selected list items.
* If all rows are unselected, the `sr-only` class is removed from the second `span` element and re-applied to the `p` element.

#### 2. Categorical computed section filters selection and status

This is **optional**.

This subcomponent allows a user to know how many list items have a categorically filterable computed status applied to them. It also allows a user to filter the ListView's list items to only show items with one of the mutually exclusive category filters.

If utilized, categorical computed section filters **must** be mutually exclusive. Examples of this are Open/Closed, Public/Private, Passed/Failed, etc.

Categorical section filters may visually look like tabs, but are functionally different. Because of this, tab-related ARIA declarations and JavaScript behavior **should not** be utilized.

The following example uses Open and Closed status as categorical section filters:

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView select all content -->
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="{url}"> Open <CounterLabel>{x}</CounterLabel> </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="{url}"> Closed <CounterLabel>{x}</CounterLabel> </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* The outermost `div` is used for positioning and styling purposes.
* A `ul` element contains the two links used to request a filtered list of Open or Closed Issues.
  * Each of the two links is contained within a `li` element.
* For the links:
  * `{url}` is a placeholder for the URL used to request a page/view for all Open or Closed Issues.
  * `{x}` is a placeholder for the number of Open or Closed issues, respectively.
  * If an Open or Closed link is selected, the following behavior occurs:
    * The declaration `aria-current="true"` is applied to the `a` element.
    * Visual treatments are applied to indicate the link's currently filtered status.

#### 3. ListView sorting status

This control has nuance that needs specific consideration that will be discussed in a subsequent PR.

#### 4. Display density toggle

This is **optional**.

This subcomponent allows a user to toggle the display density of a ListView's list items. The two display densities a user can choose from are:

1. Comfortable, and
2. Condensed.

##### General behavior

If no preference is expressed by the component author, the display density defaults to **comfortable**.

The subcomponent uses [SegmentedControl](https://primer.style/react/SegmentedControl).

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView select all content -->
    <!-- ListView categorical section filter content -->
    <div>
      <fieldset>
        <legend class="sr-only">{title} display density</legend>
        <div>
          <input
            class="sr-only"
            checked
            type="radio"
            name="uuid-list-view-density"
            id="uuid-list-view-density-comfortable"
          />
          <label for="uuid-list-view-density-comfortable">
            <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
              <!-- RowsIcon Octicon SVG code -->
            </svg>
            <span class="sr-only">Comfortable</span>
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input class="sr-only" type="radio" name="uuid-list-view-density" id="uuid-list-view-density-condensed" />
          <label for="uuid-list-view-density-condensed">
            <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
              <!-- ThreeBarsIcon Octicon SVG code -->
            </svg>
            <span class="sr-only">Condensed</span>
          </label>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* A `fieldset` element is placed as the immediate child of the containing `div` element.
* A `legend` element is used to programmatically communicate the purpose of the the controls placed in the `fieldset`.
  * The `{title}` part of the `legend`'s string defined in the ListView's [container title](#container-title).
  * The string " display density" is then appended after `{title}`. Note the space before the word "display".
* Two `div`s are then placed as child elements following the `legend` element. These are suggestions for layout and styling purposes. Each `div` contains:
  * An `input` element with the following declarations:
    * `type="radio"` to make the density toggle options mutually exclusive.
    * `class="sr-only` to visually hide the radio button.
    * `name="uuid-list-view-density"` to prevent namespace collisions if more than one ListView component is used on the same page or view.
    * An `id` attribute:
      * The `id` value for the comfortable option is `uuid-list-view-density-comfortable`
      * The `id` value for the condensed option is `uuid-list-view-density-condensed`
  * Following the `input` element is a `label` element with the following declarations:
    * A `for` attribute:
      * The `for` value for the comfortable option is `uuid-list-view-density-comfortable`.
      * The `for` value for the condensed option is `uuid-list-view-density-condensed`.
      * This programmatically associates the `label`'s string value with its associated `input`.
    * Within each `label` element there are two child elements:
      1. A SVG element:
      * Declarations of `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` ensure the icon's presence is marked as decorative for assistive technology.
      * The [three-bars Octicon](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/three-bars-16) SVG code is used for the comfortable option.
      * The [rows Octicon](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/rows-16) SVG code is used for the condensed option.
      2. A `span` element:
      * A declaration of `class="sr-only"` to visually hide the label's accessible name.
      * The string "Comfortable" for the comfortable option.
      * The string "Condensed" for the condensed option.
      * This ensures two icons are visually shown and are clickable via the `label`'s `for`/`id` association, but have accessible roles and names that will make sense to assistive technology users.
  * Additionally, the Comfortable option can be set as default by applying a declaration of `checked` to the `input` with an `id` of `uuid-list-view-density-comfortable`.
* Primer's [SegmentedControl](https://primer.style/react/SegmentedControl) can also be used to achieve this functionality.
  * The `title` used in the [SegmentedControl](https://primer.style/react/SegmentedControl)'s `aria-label` value is a placeholder for the component author-supplied string used for [the container title](#container-title).
  * SegmentedControl is used for the subcomponent, using [its icons-only configuration](https://primer.style/react/SegmentedControl#with-icons-only).
    * The comfortable IconButton uses the [RowsIcon](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/rows-16) Octicons, with an `aria-label` value of "Comfortable".
    * The condensed IconButton uses the [ThreeBarsIcon](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/three-bars-16) Octicons, with an `aria-label` value of "Condensed".

#### 5. Additional actions

This is **optional**.

This subcomponent allows a user to access and optionally activate other actions that would affect the entire ListView. The actions themselves are author-defined.

It is strongly encouraged to only use the additional actions subcomponent when **two or more** actions are present.

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView select all content -->
    <!-- ListView Open and Closed Issues filter content -->
    <!-- ListView display density toggle content -->
    <div>
      <ActionMenu>
        <ActionMenu.Button>
          <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
            <!-- KebabHorizontalIcon Octicon SVG code -->
          </svg>
          <span class="sr-only">Actions: {title}</span>
        </ActionMenu.Button>
        <ActionMenu.Overlay>
          <ActionList>
            <ActionList.Item>Action 1</ActionList.Item>
            <ActionList.Item>Action 2</ActionList.Item>
            <ActionList.Item>Action 3</ActionList.Item>
          </ActionList>
        </ActionMenu.Overlay>
      </ActionMenu>
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* `<ActionMenu.Button>` contains two declarations:
  1. A SVG declaration that uses `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false` to mark it as decorative. The SVG should use the [KebabHorizontalIcon](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/kebab-horizontal-16) Octicon.
  2. A visually hidden `span` whose string is "Actions: title". `title` is a placeholder for the component author-supplied string used for [the container title](#container-title).
* Each `<ActionList.Item>`'s string value <strong>must</strong> concisely and accurately describe the action it represents.
  * If ActionList Items use leading visual icons they must be marked as decorative. Use the following techniques:
    * If the icon is a SVG, apply declarations of `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false` on the `svg` element.
    * If the icon is a raster image (PNG, JPG, etc.), use a declaration of `alt=""` on the `img` element.

#### 6. Persist density selection

This is **optional**.

This subcomponent allows to persist the selection of the display density (i.e either Comfortable or Condensed) of a ListView's list items in local storage.

##### General behavior

Once a user select's either **Comfortable** or **condensed** display density, the selection is persisted in local storage. The next time the user visits the page/view, the ListView's display density will be set to the user's previous selection.

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView select all content -->
    <!-- ListView categorical section filter content -->
    <div>
      <SegmentedControl onChange="{handleDensityChange}">
        <SegmentedControl.IconButton defaultSelected icon="{RowsIcon}" aria-label="Comfortable" />
        <SegmentedControl.IconButton icon="{ThreeBarsIcon}" aria-label="Condensed" />
      </SegmentedControl>
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* The `handleDensityChange` used in the [SegmentedControl](https://primer.style/react/SegmentedControl)'s `onChange` value is a function that is used to handle the density selection change. The persistance to localStorage is handled within this function.

### Announcements

A user who cannot see the screen needs a mechanism to help reactively communicate feedback after certain actions are undertaken. Examples include confirmation of loading, deletion, duplication, etc.

To accomplish this, the ListView uses a dedicated announcement subcomponent. This subcomponent uses a combination of [`aria-live`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-live) and other companion declarations.

Announcements **cannot** be the primary mechanism to communicate feedback. Certain assistive technologies cannot parse `aria-live`, or can have their preferences set in such a way that `aria-live` announcements are suppressed. Because of this, `aria-live` announcements **must only** be used to provide messaging that aids in understanding, but is not the sole method for understanding what has occurred.

Specific subcomponent announcement criteria will be listed in applicable sections. This section provides the mechanism to dispatch the announcement messages.

`aria-live` announcements can **only** be text strings. Formatting such a `strong` tags, links, and other text-level content will be "flattened" and have their semantics removed.

If the ListView component is being used on GitHub.com, it can utilize [aria-live.ts](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/aria-live/aria-live.ts) to perform announcements.

##### DOM declarations

```html
<div id="uuid-list-view-container">
  <!-- ListView container title -->
  <div id="uuid-list-view-metadata">
    <!-- ListView select all content -->
    <!-- ListView Open and Closed Issues filter content -->
    <!-- ListView display density toggle content -->
    <!-- ListView action menu content -->
    <div id="uuid-list-view-announcements" role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" class="sr-only">
      {ListView announcement string}
    </div>
    <!-- Other ListView metadata content -->
  </div>
  <!-- ListView list -->
</div>
```

* A div element is added to the ListView construct with declarations of `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`, and `aria-atomic="true"`.
  * The declaration of `role="status"` helps assistive technology understand the announcement's type.
  * The declaration of `aria-live="polite"` ensures the way that assistive technology will announce the status update.
  * The declaration of `aria-atomic="true"` ensures that all updates for announcement string area are announced.
* The `sr-only` class applied to the `div` ensures that the status message is not visible.
* `{ListView announcement string}` is a placeholder for the announcement string.
  * Announcement messages are written to this area when triggered.
  * New messages written in place of an existing message will re-trigger an assistive technology announcement.
