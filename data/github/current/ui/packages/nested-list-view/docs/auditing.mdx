## ListView accessibility auditing script

This document can be used to help evaluate the accessibility of [the ListView component](https://ui.githubapp.com/storybook/?path=%2Fdocs%2Frecipes-nested-list-view--readme).

## Context

Nested ListView is a [tree view pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/), based off of [Primer's Tree View component](https://primer.style/components/tree-view).

Tree views on the web are expected to only support one action per node. To address this, the Nested ListView also uses a dialog to help users access secondary actions.

The secondary actions dialog is triggered by a keyboard shortcut. The shortcut is both announced by assistive technology and also and visible to keyboard users. Extending the tree view to support this dialog is a unique pattern that is not covered by the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/). This does not mean that it is inacessible, however.

Because of this atypical behavior, it is helpful to have a script to reference when evaluating the ListView component’s accessibility.

Certain behaviors might be different from what an auditor is familiar with in their regular evaluation workflows. This does not mean that it is inaccessible. The following script will help verify intended, accessible behavior.

### Note about output

**Navigation behavior is more important than verbatim output**.

Certain qualities such as the heading level, list item number, and presence of interactivity may or may not be announced depending on [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)’s settings and navigation technique used.

## Example

<img alt="A list of 11 GitHub issues. Four of the issues are parent level, which is indicated by an expand/collapse chevron icon. One of the issues is expanded, and contains four child issues. Each issue has a selection checkbox, a status icon, a title, and issue number, an assignee, and oveflow actions. Some issues also have an issue type prefix, labels, and a comment tally. Parent-level issues also have a completion tally badge, which shows how many of their child issues have been closed. Before the list of issues are bulk level actions for selecting all issues, filtering by open or closed issues, and sorting." src={imageExampleNestedListView} />

Nested ListView used to list issues for a GitHub repository, and their parent/child relationships:

## Nested ListView title

<img alt="A sample Nested ListView component with a small light purple rectangle positioned above it. The rectangle is labeled, 'Title (visually hidden)'." src={imageTitle} />

The Nested ListView title provides the Nested ListView with a heading to help identify and navigate to it with assistive technology. Nested ListView titles are set to be visually hidden by default.

### Navigating to a Nested ListView title in NVDA

The Nested ListView is announced as a heading.

* Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to navigate by next item until the Nested ListView title is announced.
* Press <kbd>h</kbd> to navigate by heading until the Nested ListView title is announced.

#### Sample ListView title output

```text
Issues. Heading level 2.
```

* Name: Issues.
* Role: Heading.
* Level 2: Indicates heading level.

The name part of the announcement will depend on the text used for the Nested ListView title. The level part of the announcement will depend on the level used for the Nested ListView title. The heading level should be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

## Nested ListView filter controls

<img alt="A sample Nested ListView component with a dark purple rectangle highlighting its filter control area. The rectangle is labeled, 'Filter controls'. The filter controls contain bulk level actions for selecting all issues, filtering by open or closed issues, and sorting." src={imageFilterControls} />

The Nested ListView filter controls allows a user to modify attributes of all Nested ListView ListItems. There are no special considerations for auditing for this content.

Nested ListView filter controls are author-supplied. Examples are display density toggles, sorting controls, and the ability to select all Nested ListView ListItems.

## Nested ListView container

<img alt="A sample Nested ListView component with a dark purple rectangle highlighting its main content area. The main content area has had its issues removed, to better emphasize the container itself. The rectangle is labeled, 'Container (uses the Nested ListView Title)' and also has an arrow pointing to the lighter purple rectangle that provides the component title." src={imageContainer} />

The ListView container contains Nested ListView ListItems.

### Navigating to a Nested ListView container in NVDA

The Nested ListView is announced as an tree view with a title.

* Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to navigate by next item until the Nested ListView title and role is announced.
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate by interactive item until the last Nested ListView ListItem to receive focus is announced. Focus defaults to the first ListItem in the Nested ListVIew component.

#### Sample ListView container output

The Nested ListView container will announce the title string, then indicate it is a list and that it is interactive.

```text
Issues. Tree view. Clickable.
```

* Name: Issues.
* Role: Tree view.
* Clickable: Indicates that the tree view is interactive.

The name part of the announcement will depend on the text used for the ListView title. This should be the same as the ListView title.

NVDA may then proceed to also announce the last focused ListItem. This depends on how NVDA's preferences have been set up.

## Nested ListView ListItems

<img alt="A single list item issue. It has a selection checkbox, an expand/collapse chevron, a status icon, an issue type, a title, a completion tally, and secondary info and actions. Contained in the secondary info and actions area are labels, a comment tally, assignees, and an overflow control. Each aspect of the issue has a corresponding label. The entire list item has a light blue rectangle drawn around it, with a label that reads, 'Nested ListView ListItem'." src={imageListItemAnatomy} />

Nested ListView ListItems are announced by assistive technology as tree view items. These announcements **intentionally** differ from what the visual order is.

The reason for this different order is to provide a more efficient experience for screen reader users. The order of announcements is:

1. Selection status (if present),
2. Issue type (if present),
3. Title/primary action,
4. Status (if present),
5. New activity (if present),
6. Completion tally (if present),
7. Trigger additional info and actions dialog ("Press Control, Shift, U for more actions.").

This difference between visual and announcement order **is not** a violation of [SC 2.4.3: Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order.html). Notably:

> The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order as long as the user can still understand and operate the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content, the focus order may match any of them.

### Navigating through Nested ListView ListItems in NVDA

* Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to:
  * Navigate to the ListItem title's destination, if the title is set to be a link.
  * Activate the ListItem title's action, if the title is set to be a button.
* Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to:
  * Check a ListItem node if ListItem selection is possible and the ListItem is in an unchecked state.
  * Uncheck a ListItem node if ListItem selection is possible and the ListItem is in an checked state.
  * Navigate to the ListItem title's destination, if the title is set to be a link. This behavior is **only** applied if a ListItem node **does not** have the ability to be checked.
  * Activate the ListItem title's action, if the title is set to be a button. This behavior is **only** applied if a ListItem node **does not** have the ability to be checked.
  * Open/expand a ListItem node if the node is in a closed/collapsed state. This behavior is **only** applied if a ListItem node **does not** have either a title link or action, or have the ability to be checked.
  * Close/collapse a ListItem node if the node is in a open/expanded state. This behavior is **only** applied if a ListItem node **does not** have either a title link or action, or have the ability to be checked.
* Press <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> to activates a dialog on the currently focused ListItem node. The dialog content is a copy of the ListItem's content, and allows assistive technology to explore and take action on ListItem node content in a focused way.
* Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss the ListItem dialog, if the dialog has been activated. Focus is returned to the ListItem.
* Press <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> to select the next ListItem node without expanding or collapsing it. Does nothing if selection is on the last ListItem in the Nested ListView component.
* Press <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> to select the previous ListItem node without expanding or collapsing it. Does nothing if selection is on the first ListItem in the Nested ListView component.
* Press <kbd>Home</kbd> to jump to the first ListItem in the Nested ListView component.
* Press <kbd>End</kbd> to jump to the last ListItem in the Nested ListView component.
* Press <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to:
  * Open/expand a parent ListItem node when selection is currently on the node and it is in a closed/collapsed state. Selection does not move.
  * Move selection to the first child ListItem node if selection is on an open node.
  * Does nothing when selection is on an end ListItem node that has no children.
* Press <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> to:
  * Move selection to a child ListItem node's parent node when selection is on a child ListItem node that is either an end ListItem node or a ListItem node placed in a closed/collapsed state.
  * Does nothing when selection is on a root ListItem node that is also either an end ListItem node, or a ListItem node placed in a closed/collapsed state.

Note: The expanding/collapsing animation of a toggle is not applicable for [SC 2.2.1: Timing Adjustable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).

#### Sample ListItem output

```text
Epic. Introduce AI in Product. Satus: Open. 1 of 3 issues completed. Press Control, Shift, U for more actions. Collapsed. 10 of 36. Level 2.
```

* Name: Epic. Introduce AI in Product. Satus: Open. 1 of 3 issues completed. Press Control, Shift, U for more actions.
* Collapsed: Indicates the ListItem is a parent ListItem and is in a collapsed state.
* 10 of 36: Enumerates the ListItem's position in the Nested ListView component, as well as how many other items are present on the list at this level.
* Level 2: Communicates the level of depth the ListItem is at in the Nested ListView component.

Enumeration (ex: 10 of 36) and level (ex: Level 2) may not be annoounced by a screen reader. This depends on the verbosity setting the user has set up.

The name part of the announcement will depend on the text used for the ListItem title. The status part of the announcement will depend on the icon used for the ListItem status. The completion tally (ex: 1 of 3 issues completed) will depend on if the component author supplies it. "Press Control, Shift, U for more actions." should always be present in the announcement.

## Nested ListView secondary actions and info dialog

<img alt="A dialog that hovers over the Nested ListVIew component It has a title of 'Manage item', a close button, a repetition of the ListItem content, and a button labeled 'Ok'." src={imageDialog} />

Secondary actions and actions on a Nested ListView ListItem can be accessed by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> when a ListItem is selected. This will trigger a dialog that displays the secondary info and action content (labels, comment tally, assignees, etc.).

The dialog will trap focus and prevent the user from navigating outside of the dialog's content. The dialog's title should be "Manage item".

Secondary info and actions are navigated, announced, and activated the way regular web content would be used.

Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> will dismiss the dialog and return focus to the ListItem that was selected when <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> was pressed.

#### Sample secondary actions and info dialog outout

```text
Manage item. Dialog.
```

* Name: Manage item.
* Role: Dialog.

## ListView focus management

<img alt="A Nested ListView component with a heading and button placed below it. Sequential numbers and a line show how focus moves from the last interactive item in the filter area of the Nested ListView component, to the first list item, then out of the Nested ListView and to the button, bypassing the non-interactive heading." src={imageFocusManagement} />

ListViews have custom focus management to help users navigate quickly and efficiently. This is slightly different than regular web content.

### Tabbing through a Nested ListView

Using <kbd>Tab</kbd> keypresses to navigate through a ListView will move focus:

1. Through **all interactive elements** in the Nested ListView filter controls content, then
2. **The first ListItem** in the Nested ListView component, or the last focused ListItem if focus was previously placed on another ListItem by the user.
3. The first interactive item placed **after** the ListView. Focus **should not** move to the next ListItem in sequence.
