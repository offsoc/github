Greetings <%= @billable_entity %>,

We’re sorry to say that your coupon for <%= branded_plan_name(@billable_entity.plan).titleize %> has expired.
<% if @education_coupon %>

If you are still a student or teacher, you may apply for a new academic discount coupon at https://education.github.com.
<% end %>

If you’d like to renew GitHub, just head to <%= @settings_url %> and click the "update payment method" button. If you need a guide to updating your payment method, our handy article at <%= help_url %> can help you out.

<% if @billable_entity.plan.legacy? %>
If you decide not to renew, you can switch to <%= branded_plan_name(GitHub::Plan.free).titleize %> and access your private repositories with limited review and collaboration features.
<% else %>
Your account is still active and has been automatically switched to <%= branded_plan_name(GitHub::Plan.free).titleize %> which will still provide access your private repositories.
<% end %>

If you have any feedback about this service, we’d love to hear what we could have done better.

If you feel there’s been a mistake or have any questions, visit <%= contact_url %>

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
