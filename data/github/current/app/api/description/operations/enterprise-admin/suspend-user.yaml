summary: Suspend a user
description: |-
  If your GitHub instance uses [LDAP Sync with Active Directory LDAP servers](${externalDocsUrl}/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap), Active Directory LDAP-authenticated users cannot be suspended through this API. If you attempt to suspend an Active Directory LDAP-authenticated user through this API, it will return a `403` response.

  You can suspend any user account except your own.

  Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP method](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."
