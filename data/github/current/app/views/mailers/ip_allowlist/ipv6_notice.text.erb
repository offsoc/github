GitHub is gradually rolling out IPv6.

As GitHub services continue to add IPv6 support, we will start recognizing IPv6 addresses of GitHub users.

To prevent possible access interruptions with the <%= @owner_name_and_type %>, please ensure you have added any necessary IPv6 addresses to your IP allow list.

If you do not update your IP allow list with all necessary IPv6 addresses, users may experience issues accessing and using the <%= @owner_name_and_type %> as IPv6 support across GitHub services increases.

Manage the <%= @owner_name_and_type %> IP allow list here:

<%= @ip_allowlist_url %>

Youâ€™re receiving this email because you manage the <%= @owner_name_and_type %>, which has an IP allow list set up.
