summary: Set default workflow permissions for a repository
description: |-
  Sets the default workflow permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` when running workflows in a repository, and sets if GitHub Actions
  can submit approving pull request reviews.
  For more information, see "[Setting the permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN for your repository](${externalDocsUrl}/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
