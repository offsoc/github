summary: Update an organization variable
description: |-
  Updates an organization variable that you can reference in a GitHub Actions workflow.

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read variables.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, the `repo` scope is also required.
