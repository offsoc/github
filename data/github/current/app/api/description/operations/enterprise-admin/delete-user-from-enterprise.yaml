      Suspends a SCIM user permanently from an enterprise. This action will: remove all the user's data,  anonymize their login, email, and display name, erase all external identity SCIM attributes, delete the user's emails, avatar, PATs, SSH keys, OAuth authorizations, GPG keys, and SAML mappings. This action is irreversible.
