summary: Create or update IdP group connections
description: |-
  Creates, updates, or removes a connection between a team and an IdP group. When adding groups to a team, you must include all new and existing groups to avoid replacing existing groups with the new ones. Specifying an empty `groups` array will remove all connections for a team.

  Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](${externalDocsUrl}/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PATCH /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/team-sync/group-mappings`.
