summary: Mark repository notifications as read
description: Marks all notifications in a repository as "read" for the current user. If the number of
  notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted`
  status and ${apiName} will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as
  "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the [List
  repository notifications for the authenticated user](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/activity/notifications#list-repository-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user)
  endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.
