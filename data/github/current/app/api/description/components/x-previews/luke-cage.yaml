  The Protected Branches API now has a setting for requiring a specified number of approving pull request reviews before merging. This feature is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-03-16-protected-branches-required-approving-reviews) for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.luke-cage-preview+json
  ```
