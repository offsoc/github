summary: Create a remove token for an organization
description: |-
  Returns a token that you can pass to the `config` script to remove a self-hosted runner from an organization. The token expires after one hour.

  For example, you can replace `TOKEN` in the following example with the registration token provided by this endpoint to remove your self-hosted runner from an organization:

  ```
  ./config.sh remove --token TOKEN
  ```

  Authenticated users must have admin access to the organization to use this endpoint.

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the`admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
