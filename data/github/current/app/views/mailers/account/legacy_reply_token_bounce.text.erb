Hello,

Weâ€™re not able to process the email you sent in response to an issue or pull request on GitHub. Likely, this is because you responded to an old email from GitHub using an address type that is no longer supported.

You can still respond to this conversation on github.com. Email responses to more recent conversations on GitHub will continue to work.

Thanks,
Your friends at GitHub
