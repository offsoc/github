# Billing

The [billing React application](https://github.com/github/github/tree/master/ui/packages/billing-app) is powered by several in-house components that control everything from creating a budget for your enterprise to showing a graph of product usage.
This document is meant to show the various stories we have created and some gotchas for the components themselves.

## Usage Filters

The `UsageFilters` currently show at the top of the overview and usage page with different variations for each page. On the overview page, we want to omit the search bar and "Group" dropdown.

On the usage page, we show a search bar to filter usage and the "Group" dropdown which can be seen below:

<Canvas of={UsageFiltersStories.UsageFilters} showSearch={false} />

*Note that changing the "Group" and "Time Frame" dropdowns won't actually update the value in StoryBook*

## Usage Card

The `UsageCard` below is shown on our overview page. The card takes on two variants, either the **repo** `UsageCard` or the **org** `UsageCard`. You can toggle between these variants in the "Controls" section of the `UsageCard` story.
