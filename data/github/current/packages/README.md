# `/packages` üì¶

This directory contains logical groupings of rails code that we've migrated to use [Packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk/blob/main/USAGE.md#what-problem-does-packwerk-solve). 

Packwerk is a gem that allows us to gradually extract logical groupings of code into ‚Äúpackages‚Äù with closely guarded public interfaces.

### Further Information
