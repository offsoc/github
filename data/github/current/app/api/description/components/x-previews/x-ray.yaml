  When a GitHub Enterprise instance is in private mode, site and repository administrators can enable anonymous Git access for a public repository. This feature is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://blog.github.com/2018-07-12-introducing-enterprise-2-14/) for full details.

  To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.x-ray-preview+json
  ```
