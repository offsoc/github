# Markdown Accessibility Table Element
This package provides a Catalyst component that attaches itself to the `<markdown-accessibility-table-element>` tag. This tag is generated in the html pipeline which wraps every `<table>` that is generated by markdown.

Currently its only goal is to detect if the table has horizontal overflow and apply a tabindex of 0 if an overflow exists for a11y purposes and compliance.
