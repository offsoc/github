summary: Update an organization webhook
description: |-
  Updates a webhook configured in an organization. When you update a webhook,
  the `secret` will be overwritten. If you previously had a `secret` set, you must
  provide the same `secret` or set a new `secret` or the secret will be removed. If
  you are only updating individual webhook `config` properties, use "[Update a webhook
  configuration for an organization](/rest/orgs/webhooks#update-a-webhook-configuration-for-an-organization)".

  You must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need `admin:org_hook` scope. OAuth apps cannot list, view, or edit
  webhooks that they did not create and users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks that were created by OAuth apps.
