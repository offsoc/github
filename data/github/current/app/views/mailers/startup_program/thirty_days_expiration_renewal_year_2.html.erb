<p style="text-align: start;">
  Hello,
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  Thank you for being a part of GitHub for Startups!
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  We're reaching out because <b>your program expiration is coming up on <%= @expiration_date %>.</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  <b>Would you like to continue on GitHub Enterprise?</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  To ensure your Enterprise plan is not interrupted, <b><u>please notify us with your intent to continue on GitHub Enterprise at least 5 business days before your program expiration.</u></b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  Once confirmed, we'll send over next steps and convert your current Enterprise Account to a <u>self-serve Enterprise Account</u> - you will not experience any interruptions during the conversion process.
  Once complete, you'll be able to manage licenses directly in your Enterprise. Enterprise seats are $21 per user per month.
</p>

<p style="text-align: start;">
  <b>If we don't hear from you, your organization will automatically be downgraded to a Free plan on your termination date,</b>
  and your Enterprise Account will be deleted. You will be notified once your organization has been removed from the Enterprise, at which time you may self-serve upgrade to the Team tier.
</p>

  Thank you again for building with GitHub for Startups! Please let us know if you have any questions.
