summary: Convert an organization member to outside collaborator
description: When an organization member is converted to an outside collaborator,
  they'll only have access to the repositories that their current team membership
  allows. The user will no longer be a member of the organization. For more information,
  see "[Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator](${externalDocsUrl}/articles/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator/)".
  Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators.
  For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](${externalDocsUrl}/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."
