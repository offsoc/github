# User-defined filters

Qualifiers that are generated based on user content. For example `static-field.custom-user-data:hello-world`.

## üö® The problem

Within issues, I can currently create a `priority` field with 3 options: `high`, `medium` and `low`.
This then becomes available within the filter syntax as `priority:high`.

However while this example sounds straightforward this solution creates **multiple problems**.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing new filters is harder

The first problem is that tomorrow we might want to introduce a `priority` field ourselves but sadly users started
using this filter key already and therefore we need to come up with a migration plan for those users. This change will
then cause friction for those users who might have relied on this for a long time.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Blacklist filters

To avoid that users create conflicting field in issues a list of filter keys needs to be maintained to ensure
no conflicts are created going forward.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-feature conflicts

If the discussions team adds a priority filter with options like urgent and non-urgent, they might not realize that
users are already using these terms in issues. At first, this won't cause any problems in their feature.
However, if they later decide to include this filter in a global search, it could become a problem.

For instance, if I want to search for all issues and discussions tagged with `priority`, I would type `priority:`.
Then, I expect to see a list of related filters like `urgent`, `non-urgent`, `high`, `medium`, and `low`.
For this to happen, the global search team has to get information from both the discussions and issues tables.
This is a challenge because it involves gathering data from different sources, which is costly at our scale.
Plus, the search results need to be combined and organized, adding to the complexity.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Slow database queries

Currently, our filters are static values, meaning we don't need to access our databases for initial suggestions.
This provides a snappy experience as be don't need to wait for the initial suggestions.
However, if we start using user-defined filters, we'll have to query the database first.
This could become complex, as users might define between 10 to 20 filters per feature, leading to large and
potentially overwhelming list of suggestions. Supporting this in global search complicates things even further.
In this case we need to extract all possible filters from multiple tables to provide these suggestions,
which could be challenging to manage efficiently

## üéâ The solution

To prevent the issues mentioned earlier, it's essential to establish a subkey specifically for user-defined filters.

For instance, rather than including a user-defined `priority` filter in the default suggestions, it's only available
within the `field` filter. This arrangement means that when a user selects the `field` suggestion, they will see
all the filters (sub-keys) they have created, including `priority`.

![There are four filter inputs, each in a unique state. The first input is empty, displaying several suggestions like 'Field'. The second input contains 'field.' and presents five suggestions, with 'Level' among them. The third input, with 'field.level:' entered, shows three suggestions including 'High'. Finally, the last input holds 'field.level:high', where 'high' is emphasized with a blue background.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/b9886d04-f55e-49ce-aec1-7dfee9582380)

We recognize that this approach requires users to type more to access their filters, but we expect the suggestions
to expedite this process. In localised experiences for example within a project view we could further
improve this experience by preloading all the user generated filters and show them when the user starts typing.
For example `pri` would return `Field: Priority` this helps for discoverability and removes the need of using `field.`.
Note that this can't be provided in a global context since it would require too many API calls.

To alleviate further concerns about length, we propose offering shorthand options as well.
For example, users can type `f.` as a quicker alternative to field.

Although we used the `field` example here, we suggest finding unique strings for each feature when there's no
direct overlap. For instance, the repositories team uses `properties` for their [custom properties](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-12-github-repository-custom-properties-beta/) feature.

Also, this method has extra advantages. Users can view all their created filters in one list within the suggestions.
In big companies, this keeps the initial suggestions from becoming too cluttered.
