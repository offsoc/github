# Nested ListView

<img alt="A Nested ListView component configured to show a repository's Issues. There are two overall parts to the component: a top metadata area, and a list of Issues. The metadata area contains controls to select all displayed issues, or filter to all open or closed issues. There are also options to toggle display density and sort. The Issues area contains eleven open issues. Each issue also has a status indicator, a title, an issue number, and overflow actions. Some issues also have issue type categories, tags, a comment tally, participants, and number of completed checklist items. Four of the issues are parent issues and display expand/collapse toggles. All but one are in a collapsed state. The expanded parent issue has three child issues." src={imageFile} />

The Nested ListView is a collection of items that can be nested to create a parent/child relationship. Each item has:

* A primary piece of information and action,
* One or multiple secondary actions, and
* Associated metadata about the primary piece of information
