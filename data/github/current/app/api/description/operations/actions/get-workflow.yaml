summary: Get a workflow
description: |-
  Gets a specific workflow. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow
  file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.

  Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
