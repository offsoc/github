Hi @<%= @sponsor %>,

As of <%= SponsorsPrimerMailer::PAYPAL_DEPRECATION_DATE_TEXT %>, GitHub Sponsors no longer supports PayPal as a payments processor. As such, it is no longer possible to sponsor individuals or organizations using PayPal. Read our changelog: <<%= @changelog_url %>>

<%= @sponsor.user? ? "You" : "@#{@sponsor}" %> still <%= @sponsor.user? ? "have" : "has" %> PayPal as <%= @sponsor.user? ? "your" : "their" %> GitHub payment method. Because of this, we cancelled the following sponsorships:

<% @sponsorships.each do |sponsorship| %>
- <%= sponsorship.tier %> for @<%= sponsorship.sponsorable_login %>
<% end %>

If you would like to sponsor these maintainers again, please first update your payment method to be a credit or debit card. You can view all your past sponsorships in your billing settings and re-sponsor them from there.

Update your payment method: <<%= @update_payment_method_url %>>

Billing settings: <<%= @past_sponsorships_url %>>
