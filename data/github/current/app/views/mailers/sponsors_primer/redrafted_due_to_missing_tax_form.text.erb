Hi @<%= @login %>,

GitHub Sponsors requires a tax form from everyone who is part of the GitHub Sponsors program. We've sent some email reminders but haven't been able to collect one from you yet. We've made the GitHub Sponsors account for @<%= @login %> a draft again until we can get a tax form.

To re-enable your account, go to your GitHub Sponsors dashboard and click the link to fill out your tax form:

<<%= sponsorable_dashboard_url(@login, anchor: "tax-form") %>>

Once you've completed the tax form, you'll be able to submit your profile for approval.

If you need a different tax form or have any questions, you can contact GitHub Support.

Thanks for being part of GitHub Sponsors!

GitHub Staff
