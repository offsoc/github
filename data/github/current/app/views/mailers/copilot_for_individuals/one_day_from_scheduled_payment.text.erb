Dear <%= @user.display_login %>,

Your trial is ending tomorrow. At the end of the trial, your GitHub Copilot subscription will continue at <%= @bill %> billed to your <%= @billing_method %>.

You can cancel your <%= Copilot.individual_product_name %> subscription trial at any time before <%= @free_trial_ends_on %> and you won't be charged.

If you do not cancel the trial before the end, the trial will automatically convert to a paid subscription starting from <%= @free_trial_ends_on %>.

Read the billing documentation for more details.

Manage subscription: <%= @settings_user_billing_path %>

You can manage your billing preferences or you can cancel your <%= Copilot.individual_product_name %> subscription at any time: <%= Copilot::COPILOT_FOR_INDIVIDUALS_BILLING_DOCUMENTATION %>
