description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Add or update team project permissions](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/teams#add-or-update-team-project-permissions) endpoint.

  Adds an organization project to a team. To add a project to a team or update the team's permission on a project, the authenticated user must have `admin` permissions for the project. The project and team must be part of the same organization.
