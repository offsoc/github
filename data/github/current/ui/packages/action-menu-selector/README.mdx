# ActionMenuSelector

{/* A precise description of your component and the use cases it covers. */}

A simple generic selector build with the `ActionMenu` component that can be used to create selectors and filters.

If you find yourself reusing a specific selector, you can add it to this package to make it more convenient to reuse.

This is why we have a `TimeFilter` component that uses the base `ActionMenuSelector`

## Example

{/* An example of the most prominent use case of your component to demonstrate its capabilities. */}

You can find examples of these filters on the rule insights page for organizations and repositories.

## How to use

{/* An implementation example of your component. Ideally it's functional so that users can run and play with it. */}

## Properties

{/* You can use the `Controls` component to display a table of properties once you have components. Make sure to import them. */}

{/* <Controls of={ ActionMenuSelector } /> */}

## Options (optional)

{/* Some components are flexible in their usage. You might want to provide the different options that users can use to customize your component. */}

## Accessibility (optional)

{/* Are there any accessibility considerations that users should be aware of? If so, list them here. */}
