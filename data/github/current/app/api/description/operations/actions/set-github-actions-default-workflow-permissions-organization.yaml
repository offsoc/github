summary: Set default workflow permissions for an organization
description: |-
  Sets the default workflow permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` when running workflows in an organization, and sets if GitHub Actions
  can submit approving pull request reviews. For more information, see
  "[Setting the permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN for your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-organization)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.
