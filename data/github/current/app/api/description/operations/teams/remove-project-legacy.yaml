summary: Remove a project from a team (Legacy)
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Remove a project from a team](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/teams#remove-a-project-from-a-team) endpoint.

  Removes an organization project from a team. An organization owner or a team maintainer can remove any project from the team. To remove a project from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user must have `read` access to both the team and project, or `admin` access to the team or project. **Note:** This endpoint removes the project from the team, but does not delete it.
