summary: Set selected repositories for an organization variable
description: |-
  Replaces all repositories for an organization variable that is available
  to selected repositories. Organization variables that are available to selected
  repositories have their `visibility` field set to `selected`.

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read variables.
  
  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, the `repo` scope is also required.
