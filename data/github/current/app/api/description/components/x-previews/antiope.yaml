  The Checks API is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the API may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-07-new-checks-api-public-beta/) for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.antiope-preview+json
  ```
