<%# Inspired by consistent hashing, each cluster member will run the ACME (Let's Encrypt)
    cronjob on a different day, and if more than 28 nodes, a different hour, which are chosen based on the
    node's position in the node list.  This should give unique times for up to 28 * 24 = 672 cluster nodes. :D

    Use 42 as an arbitrary minute so we don't slam the ACME servers at the top of the hour.
    Also, use only the first 28 days of the month to avoid issues with February. -%>
