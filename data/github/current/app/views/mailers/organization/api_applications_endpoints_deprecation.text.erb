Hello there!

On <%= @time %>, your application (<%= @application.name %>) issued a request using the deprecated form of OAuth Application API that includes access tokens in the URL path. GitHub has deprecated these endpoints and replaced them with a version that accepts access tokens in the request body.

The deprecated endpoints will be removed on May 5th, 2021 at 4:00 PM UTC.

Please visit <%= "#{GitHub.developer_blog_url}/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint" %> for more information about suggested changes, brownouts, and removal dates.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
