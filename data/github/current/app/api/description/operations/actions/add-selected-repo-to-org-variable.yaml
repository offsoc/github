summary: Add selected repository to an organization variable
description: |-
  Adds a repository to an organization variable that is available to selected repositories.
  Organization variables that are available to selected repositories have their `visibility` field set to `selected`.

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
