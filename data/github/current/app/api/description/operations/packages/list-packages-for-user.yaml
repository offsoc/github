summary: List packages for a user
description: |-
  Lists all packages in a user's namespace for which the requesting user has access.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](${externalDocsUrl}/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

    description: The type of supported package. Packages in GitHub's Gradle registry have the type `maven`. Docker images pushed to GitHub's Container registry (`ghcr.io`) have the type `container`. You can use the type `docker` to find images that were pushed to GitHub's Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`), even if these have now been migrated to the Container registry.
