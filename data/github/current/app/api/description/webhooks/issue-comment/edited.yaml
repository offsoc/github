summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a comment on an issue or pull request. For more information about issues and pull requests, see "[About issues](${externalDocsUrl}/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)" and "[About pull requests](${externalDocsUrl}/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)." For information about the APIs to manage issue comments, see [the GraphQL documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#issuecomment) or "[Issue comments](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/issues/comments)" in the REST API documentation.

  For activity relating to an issue as opposed to comments on an issue, use the `issue` event. For activity related to pull request reviews or pull request review comments, use the `pull_request_review` or `pull_request_review_comment` events. For more information about the different types of pull request comments, see "[Working with comments](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/working-with-comments)."

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Issues" repository permission.
