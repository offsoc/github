# WebCommitDialog

A dialog used to commit web edits to a git branch.

## Example

```
 <WebCommitDialog
    dialogProps={{onClose, position: 'right', height: 'auto'}}
    fileStatuses={fileStatuses}
    webCommitInfo={payload.webCommitInfo}
    onSave={saveHandler}
    helpUrl={payload.helpUrl}
    refName={payload.refInfo.name}
    dialogState={dialogState}
    setDialogState={setDialogSaveState}
    disableQuickPull={true}
    message={message}
    setMessage={setMessage}
    description={description}
    setDescription={setDescription}
    setAuthorEmail={setAuthorEmail}
    isQuickPull={false}
  />
```

## How to use

Most of the dialog and property state is maintained outside the dialog itself. Pass in the state and setters and
save handler to run once the changes are committed.
