  Gets information about an organization's Copilot subscription, including seat breakdown
  and feature policies. To configure these settings, go to your organization's settings on GitHub.com.
  For more information, see "[Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](${externalDocsUrl}/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-policies-for-copilot-business-in-your-organization)".

  Only organization owners can view details about the organization's Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscription.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot` or `read:org` scopes to use this endpoint.
