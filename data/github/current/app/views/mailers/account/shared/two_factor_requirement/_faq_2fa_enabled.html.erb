<%# This is the 2FA _enabled_ FAQ %>

<h2>What to know about the required 2FA initiative</h2>

<p>
  We are enrolling GitHub users who manage or author code on GitHub.
  You are one of those people!
  More information about our plan to increase 2FA adoption can be found in <a href="https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13">this blog post.</a>
This is a GitHub.com program, and unrelated to your organization or enterprise membership. 
</p>

<%# Since they already have 2FA enabled, it's important to put this towards the top of the FAQ %>
<h3>I already have 2FA enabled, do I need to do anything?</h3>

<p>
  No, you don't need to take any additional actions.
  After <%= @two_factor_required_by %>, you will no longer be able to disable 2FA for your account, but you will still be able to update your 2FA methods and settings.
</p>

<p>
  Critically, if you disable 2FA between now and <%= @two_factor_required_by %>, your access to GitHub.com will be restricted after the deadline if you don't re-enable 2FA.
</p>

<h3>What forms of 2FA can I use?</h3>

<p>
  We want you to have the most seamless experience with 2FA possible, so you can choose one or more of the following options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security key</li>
  <li>GitHub Mobile</li>
  <li>Authenticator application (TOTP)</li>
  <li>Text messages (SMS)</li>
</ul>

<%# Since we know they have 2FA, we can put a little plug in here to prompt them to have at least 2 methods enabled. %>
<p>
  You should set up at least two of these options, to ensure you always have access to your account.
  Head to <a href="https://github.com/settings/security">https://github.com/settings/security</a> to enroll more 2FA methods.
</p>

<h3>What happens to my PATs and SSH keys at the deadline?</h3>

<p>
  Your PATs, SSH keys, and applications will all keep working after the deadline, regardless of your 2FA enrollment.
  PATs in particular are used extensively in important automation, and interruption there can cause outages in critical systems.
</p>

<h3>What do I do if I lose my 2FA device?</h3>

<p>
  GitHub strongly encourages the use of multiple second factor options.
  If you lose all of your second factors, recovery codes are the only way to access your account again.
  By saving your recovery codes, you'll be able to regain access.
</p>

<p>
  Be sure to enable cloud backup for your authenticator app and save your recovery codes.
  Many phones and computers can be security keys as well - registering them with GitHub.com gives you additional, highly-secure 2FA methods.
</p>

<p>
  For security reasons, GitHub Support may not be able to restore access to accounts with 2FA enabled if you lose your 2FA credentials and lose access to your account recovery methods.
</p>

<p>
  More information about recovery codes can be found on GitHub Help at <a href="<%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials"><%= GitHub.help_url %>/articles/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials</a>
</p>

<h3>Why is GitHub requiring 2FA?</h3>

<p>
  Ensuring account security is a shared responsibility GitHub takes seriously.
  Strong authentication and the use of 2FA have been recognized as best practice for many years.
  We feel that GitHub has a duty to lead this push toward strong authentication as part of protecting the software supply chain.
