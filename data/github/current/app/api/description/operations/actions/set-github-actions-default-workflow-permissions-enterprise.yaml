summary: Set default workflow permissions for an enterprise
description: |-
  Sets the default workflow permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` when running workflows in an enterprise, and sets
  whether GitHub Actions can submit approving pull request reviews. For more information, see
  "[Enforcing a policy for workflow permissions in your enterprise](${externalDocsUrl}/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-workflow-permissions-in-your-enterprise)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:enterprise` scope to use this endpoint.
