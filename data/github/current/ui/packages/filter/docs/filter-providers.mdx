# Standard Filter Providers

## How to use

In order to utilize a filter provider, simply import the providers you need and pass them in an array to the `Filter` component using the `providers` prop.

```tsx
import {AssigneeFilterProvider, StatusFilterProvider} from '@github-ui/filter/providers'

...

const filterProviders = useMemo(() => ([
  new AssigneeFilterProvider({
    currentUserLogin: this.currentUser.login,
    currentUserAvatarUrl: this.currentUser.avatarUrl,
  }),
  new StatusFilterProvider({
    filterTypes: {
      inclusive: true,
      exclusive: true,
      valueless: true,
      multiKey: true,
      multiValue: false,
    },
  })
]), [])

<Filter providers={[AssigneeFilterProvider]} />
```

## Options

### `priority`

The priority order of the filter, from 1 to 10. The lower the number, the higher the priority. Any filter priority larger than 5 doesn't show up in the default filter suggestions, only after the user has started filtering.

Each FilterProvider listed below has a default priority, but you can override it by passing this `priority` option.

### `support`

#### `status`

The support status of the filter. The default is `supported`, but can also be `unsupported` or `deprecated`. In the event that a filter is deprecated, it will still be supported, but will not show up in the filter suggestions. Additionally, both `deprecated` and `unsupported` will show a validation message to the user.

#### `message`

The message to show to the user when the filter is `deprecated` or `unsupported`. This is only used when the `support` is `deprecated` or `unsupported`.

### `filterTypes`

#### `inclusive`

Whether the filter is inclusive or not. The default is `true`. Inclusive filters are used to include items that match the filter.

#### `exclusive`

Whether the filter is exclusive or not. The default is `true`. Exclusive filters are used to exclude items that match the filter.

#### `valueless`

Whether the filter supports fields with no value. The default is `true`. Valueless filters are used to include items that don't have a value, for example `assignee:none` would get items that don't have an assignee set.

#### `multiKey`

Whether the filter supports multiple keys. The default is `true`. Multi-key filters are used to chain queries to the same field together with `AND`. For example: `assignee:monalisa assignee:hubot` would get items that are assigned to both `monalisa` and `hubot`.

#### `multiValue`

Whether the filter supports multiple values. The default is `true`. Multi-value filters are used to chain queries to the same field together with `OR`. For example: `assignee:monalisa,hubot` would get items that are assigned to either `monalisa` or `hubot`.
