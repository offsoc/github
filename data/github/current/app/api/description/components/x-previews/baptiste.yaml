  The `is_template` and `template_repository` keys are currently available for developer to preview. See [Create a repository using a template](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-using-a-template) to learn how to create template repositories. To access these new response keys during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:

  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.baptiste-preview+json
  ```
