summary: Get a user using their ID
description: |-
  Provides publicly available information about someone with a GitHub account. This method takes their durable user `ID` instead of their `login`, which can change over time.

  The `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your ${apiName} [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with ${apiName}. For more information, see [Authentication](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#authentication).

  The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly. For more information, see "[Emails API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/users/emails)".
