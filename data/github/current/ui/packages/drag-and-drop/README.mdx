# Drag and Drop

The [Drag and Drop package](https://github.com/github/github/tree/master/ui/packages/drag-and-drop) is GitHub's accessible
and approved implementation for providing Drag and Drop features within the GitHub React Ecosystem.

Please see the [initial announcement](https://github.com/github/collaboration-workflows/discussions/107) for more details
about its goals and history.

## Components

⚠️ Important: In order for a drag and drop feature to be accessible to all user, the feature must include both the [Move modal](https://ui.githubapp.com/storybook/?path=/story/utilities-draganddrop--move-modal) and keyboard specific dragging, or the six-dot icon that enables traditional dragging. Learn more about why both functionalities are necessary for an accessible experience in our [accessibility drag and drop documentation.](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/drag-and-drop/technical-guidance/one-dimensional-DND.md)

The following are the top level components that we provide that are exported from this package. They currently support one dimensional lists of items,
either horizontally or vertically. For backwards compatibility reasons we currently export all top level libraries from the
[@dnd-kit repo](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#packages-contained-within-this-repository) as
well.

### `DragAndDrop`

Wrapper for the sortable list and item components.

<ArgTypes of={DragAndDrop} />

### `DragAndDrop.Item`

A sortable list item. This component is responsible for managing the drag trigger and preview.

<ArgTypes of={DragAndDrop.Item} />

### `DragAndDrop.MoveModal`

A modal that allows the user to move an item to a new position in the list.

<ArgTypes of={DragAndDrop.MoveModal} />

### `DragAndDrop.MoveModalTrigger`

A trigger component that opens the move modal when clicked.

Props are dynamic based on the `Component` prop that gets passed in. Please see the [source code](https://github.com/github/github/blob/master/ui/packages/drag-and-drop/components/MoveModalTrigger.tsx)
for more information.
