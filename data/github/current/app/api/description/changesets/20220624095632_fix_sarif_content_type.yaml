description: Change Content-Type of SARIF response

# To further elaborate on the details of the change or its effects.
notes: |-
  When trying to receive the SARIF upload by setting the `Accept` header to `application/sarif+json` the response `Content-Type` would incorrectly be set to `application/json+sarif`.
  This breaking change corrects this so the response `Content-Type` in this case becomes `application/sarif+json`.
