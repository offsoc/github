summary: Create a discussion (Legacy)
description: |-
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Create a discussion`](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/discussions#create-a-discussion) endpoint.

  Creates a new discussion post on a team's page.

  This endpoint triggers [notifications](${externalDocsUrl}/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Best practices for using the REST API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `write:discussion` scope to use this endpoint.
