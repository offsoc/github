Hey there,

<% if @billable_entity.has_valid_payment_method? || @billable_entity.invoiced? -%>
Thanks for using GitHub! A while ago you used a GitHub coupon that was good for <%= @coupon.human_discount %> off <%= @coupon.human_duration %> of <%= branded_plan_name(@billable_entity.plan) %> . This coupon will expire in <%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now @redemption.expires_at %> (<%= @redemption.expires_at.strftime('%B %d, %Y') %>) and your account will be charged for the existing subscription on the next billing date.

Since you already have a <%= @billable_entity.friendly_payment_method_name %> on file you don’t need to take any additional actions. We just wanted to let you know that you’ll be charged full price(<%= @payment_amount %>/<%= @billable_entity.plan_duration %>) after your coupon expires.

<%= @settings_url %> - in case you’d like to upgrade/downgrade

We noticed you haven’t entered any payment information yet. If you’d like to continue using (<%= branded_plan_name(@billable_entity.plan).titleize %> - <%=@payment_amount %>/<%= @billable_entity.plan_duration %>) you’ll need to add a valid payment method to your account. After your coupon expires, we’ll charge your account, and you can keep working without interruption.

<%= @settings_url %> - enter a payment method

Want to downgrade? You'll still have access to your private repositories on <%= branded_plan_name(GitHub::Plan.free).titleize %>.

We hope you've enjoyed trying out <%= branded_plan_name(GitHub::Plan.pro).titleize %>. Please let us know if you have any questions. Visit <%= contact_url %>
