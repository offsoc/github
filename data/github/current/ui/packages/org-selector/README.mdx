# OrgSelector

{/* A precise description of your component and the use cases it covers. */}

Allow users to select organizations from a dropdown

## Example

{/* An example of the most prominent use case of your component to demonstrate its capabilities. */}

The initial use case of this component is to allow users to select specific Organizations to target for their
Enterprise-level Member Privilege Rulesets.

## How to use

{/* An implementation example of your component. Ideally it's functional so that users can run and play with it. */}

## Properties

{/* You can use the `ArgTypes` component to display a table of properties once you have components. Make sure to import them. */}

{/* <ArgTypes of={ OrgSelector } /> */}

## Options (optional)

{/* Some components are flexible in their usage. You might want to provide the different options that users can use to customize your component. */}

## Accessibility (optional)

{/* Are there any accessibility considerations that users should be aware of? If so, list them here. */}

This uses Primer's SelectPanel component underneath the hood, so it has the same level of accessibility as that component.
