summary: Update Git LFS preference
description: |-
  You can import repositories from Subversion, Mercurial, and TFS that include files larger than 100MB. This ability
  is powered by [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com).

  You can learn more about our LFS feature and working with large files [on our help
  site](${externalDocsUrl}/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files).

  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** Due to very low levels of usage and available alternatives, this endpoint is deprecated and will no longer be available from 00:00 UTC on April 12, 2024. For more details and alternatives, see the [changelog](https://gh.io/source-imports-api-deprecation).
