Visit <%= settings_security_url %> to create a new, strong password for your GitHub account. To keep your account secure, you will be required to change your password before you can continue to use GitHub.

If you have already changed your password, no further action is required.

To help prevent this from happening in the future, here are some things to verify:
1. Make sure your password is not accidentally defined in your .gitconfig file (e.g. in the email or name field).
2. Do not to commit any content that contains your password to a repository.
