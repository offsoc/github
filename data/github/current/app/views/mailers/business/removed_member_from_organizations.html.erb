    Hi @<strong><%= @user.display_login %></strong>,
  </p>
<% end %>

<p>
  <strong>You’ve been removed from <%= pluralize(@orgs_count, "organization") %></strong>
  in the <%= @business.name %> enterprise because you don’t have two-factor
  authentication on your user account. The <%= @business.name %> enterprise
  requires all of its organization members to have two-factor authentication enabled.
</p>

<%= render(Mail::ContainerComponent.new) do %>
  <%= render(
    Mail::ButtonComponent.new(
      text: "Turn on two-factor authentication",
      url: settings_security_url(via_email: "1"),
      classes: "btn-primary btn-large"
    )
  ) %>
<% end %>

<%= render(Mail::SpacerComponent.new) %>

<p>
  <strong>What happens after that?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  After you’ve enabled two-factor authentication, contact a member of each of your
  organizations to let them know you want your access restored.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Organizations you have been removed from:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <% @organizations.each do |org| %>
    <strong><%= org.safe_profile_name %></strong>
    <%= link_to "@#{org.display_login}", user_url(org) %><br>
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>
  Only a person with owner permissions in each organization can restore your membership and
  previous privileges directly. If the person you contact isn’t an
  organization owner, <a href="<%= @lookup_org_owner_help_doc_url %>">they can
  look up an organization owner</a> and forward your request to them.
