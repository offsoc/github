      question: "Are these costs final?",
      answer: "Prices provided by the Pricing Calculator are estimates (provided in $USD) for paid services and excludes any free entitlements. The price estimates are for discussion purposes only and are not intended as binding price quotes. Actual prices for GitHub services may vary depending upon the date of purchase, currency of payment, and type of agreement you enter with GitHub."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the pricing calculator include entitlements?",
      answer: "These cost calculations are only estimates and do not include any entitlements (free goods or services).

    {
      question: "Is the cost for Codespaces project-based?",
      answer: "Yes, the pricing calculator will help you get cost estimates to create, run, and store codespaces for a specific project within your GitHub organization. To get the final cost estimate for Codespaces across multiple projects, you can estimate the individual cost for each project using the calculator and add those up."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I figure out my average project size?",
      answer: "A codespace stores the entirety of your container, including anything in your Docker image or the base Docker image you may point to (`FROM` statement in Dockerfile)—up to 32GB of space. Project size includes any files relating to your codespace, like the size of the cloned repository, configuration files/scripts/packages installed using the `postCreateCommand`, extensions, and more.

    },
    {
      question: "What if I don’t use all my storage?",
      answer: "You’ll only be charged for the space your codespace uses, not the max size. For example, if your Docker image, repository source, and dependencies add up to 10GB and you’re using a plan with 32GB of storage, you’ll only be charged for 10GB. If you create a codespace and stop using it, you can delete it and use the storage for something else.

    },
    {
      question: "What’s the storage cost if I create a codespace with the default image?",
      answer: "For a [base Linux image](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project#using-the-default-configuration), storage costs include the image size and the repository it supports. The size of the default image (as of September 2021) is 10GB and can grow based on updates over time. To save on storage, try using scenario-optimized images from the [dev container definitions repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/codespaces-linux) or bring your own container images to [create a custom configuration](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project#creating-a-custom-codespace-configuration)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is the cost for Packages lower with Actions?",
      answer: "GitHub Packages’ bandwidth is provided as a part of Actions workflows. Using Actions and Packages together will save some costs associated with bandwidth usage. But it’s still possible to incur a bandwidth charge for Packages usage outside of Actions workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Packages bandwidth free if I use Actions?",
      answer: "Yes, Packages bandwidth used for Actions workflows is free.

      question: "How can I view or manage my billing and minutes once I've signed up?",
