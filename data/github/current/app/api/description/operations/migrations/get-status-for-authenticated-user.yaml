summary: Get a user migration status
description: |-
  Fetches a single user migration. The response includes the `state` of the migration, which can be one of the following values:

  *   `pending` - the migration hasn't started yet.
  *   `exporting` - the migration is in progress.
  *   `exported` - the migration finished successfully.
  *   `failed` - the migration failed.

  Once the migration has been `exported` you can [download the migration archive](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/migrations/users#download-a-user-migration-archive).
