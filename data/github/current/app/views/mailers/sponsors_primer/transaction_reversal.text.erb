Hi @<%= @sponsorable %>,

This is an automated email from GitHub Sponsors to let you know a transaction was reversed.

This can happen for a number of reasons. You may wish to remove @<%= @sponsor %> from being able to access any tier perks.

To see a record of your transactions, you can visit your Stripe dashboard: <%= @stripe_account.stripe_dashboard_url %>

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact GitHub Support: <%= SponsorsListing.support_url %>
