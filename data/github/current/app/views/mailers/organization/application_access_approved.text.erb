An organization owner has approved the following application to access private data in the <%= @org_name %> organization:

  "<%= @app_name %>" from <%= @app_owner_name %>

Because you are a member of the <%= @org_name %> organization and have already granted this application access to your personal account, <%= @app_name %> can now access <%= @org_name %> organization resources on your behalf.

You can always see the full list of applications that have access to your account here:

  <%= settings_user_applications_url %>

If you choose to stop using one of those applications, you can revoke its access at any time.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
