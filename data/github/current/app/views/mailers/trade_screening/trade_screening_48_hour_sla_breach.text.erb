Hello,

We have an account that was put into a "hit_in_review" screening status 72 hours ago and has not yet resolved to another status.
The External ID of the account is <%= @external_uuid %>.

This is an automated message that was sent due to the SLA breach. If this business partner has been acted upon, and is no longer in the hit_in_review state please feel free to disregard this message.

Please reply back to this email only if the GitHub trade team needs to take further action.
Thank you!
