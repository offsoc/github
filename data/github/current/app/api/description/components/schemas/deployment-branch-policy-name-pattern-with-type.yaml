      The name pattern that branches or tags must match in order to deploy to the environment.

      Wildcard characters will not match `/`. For example, to match branches that begin with `release/` and contain an additional single slash, use `release/*/*`.
      For more information about pattern matching syntax, see the [Ruby File.fnmatch documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).
