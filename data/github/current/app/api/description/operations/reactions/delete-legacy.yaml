  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deprecation notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Reactions API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new delete reactions endpoints. For more information, see this [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-26-new-delete-reactions-endpoints/).

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `write:discussion` scope to use this endpoint when deleting from a [team discussion](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/discussions#get-a-discussion) or [team discussion comment](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/teams/discussion-comments#get-a-discussion-comment).
