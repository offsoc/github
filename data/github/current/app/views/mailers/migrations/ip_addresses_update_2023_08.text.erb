We're making changes to GitHub Enterprise Importer's IP addresses

We're making changes to the IP addresses used by GitHub Enterprise Importer for outbound network connections.

If you use IP allowlisting on your migration source or target, or an Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3 account which you use for migrations, then you'll need to update your allow list.

For a list of our IP ranges and more information, see "Configuring IP allow lists for migrations" in the GitHub Docs (https://docs.github.com/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/preparing-to-migrate-with-github-enterprise-importer/managing-access-for-github-enterprise-importer#configuring-ip-allow-lists-for-migrations).

This change will take affect at 00:00 UTC on September 18, 2023.

If you don't use IP allowlisting or if you're not planning to run more migrations with GitHub Enterprise Importer, you can ignore this message.

You're receiving this email because you have run at least one migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer in the last 90 days.
