Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

<% end %>
<% case @reason %>
<% when "two_factor_requirement_non_compliance" %>
You’ve been removed as a collaborator on <%= org_name %>’s repositories because you don’t have two-factor authentication on your user account. The <%= org_name %> organization requires all affiliated users to have two-factor authentication enabled.

What happens after that?

After you’ve enabled two-factor authentication, contact a member of <%= org_name %> to let them know you want your access restored. Only a person with owner permissions in your organization can restore your previous privileges directly. If the person you contact isn’t an organization owner, they can look up an organization owner (<%= @lookup_org_owner_help_doc_url %>) and forward your request to them.

Visit <%= settings_security_url %> to enable two-factor authentication on your account.
<% else %>
You’ve been removed as a collaborator on <%= org_name %>’s repositories.
<% end %>

You no longer have access to the following repositories:

<%= @repository_names.map { |e| "\"#{e}\"" }.join("\n") %>
