      <p>Pan Dan Chee looked at me. &#8220;What,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;could that have been?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;It sounded very much like a laugh to me,&#8221; I replied.</p>

      <p>Pan Dan Chee nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;but how can there be a laugh
      where there is no one to laugh?&#8221; Pan Dan Chee was perplexed.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Perhaps the ulsios of Horz have learned to laugh,&#8221; I suggested with a
      smile.</p>

      <p>Pan Dan Chee ignored my flippancy. &#8220;We saw a light and we heard a
      laugh,&#8221; he said thoughtfully. &#8220;What does that convey to you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;The same thing that it conveys to you,&#8221; I said: &#8220;that there is some
      one down here in the pits of Horz beside us.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I do not see how that can be possible,&#8221; he said.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s investigate,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

      <p>With drawn swords we advanced; for we did not know the nature nor the
      temper of the owner of that laugh, and there was always the chance that
      an ulsio might leap from one of the dungeons and attack us.</p>

        <p>The corridor ran straight for some distance, and then commenced to
        curve. There were many branches and intersections, but we kept to what
        we believed to be the main corridor. We saw no more lights, heard no
        more laughter. There was not a sound in all that vast labyrinth of
        passageways other than the subdued clanking of our metal, the
        occasional shuffling of our sandalled feet, and the soft whisperings of
        our leather harnesses.</p>

        <p>&#8220;It is useless to search farther,&#8221; said Pan Dan Chee at last. &#8220;We might
        as well start back.&#8221;</p>

        <p>Now I had no intention of going back to my death. I reasoned that the
        light and the laugh indicated the presence of man in these pits. If the
        inhabitants of Horz knew nothing of them; then they must enter the pits
        from outside the citadel, indicating an avenue of escape open to me.
        Therefore, I did not wish to retrace our steps; so I suggested that we
        rest for a while and discuss our future plans.</p>

        <p>&#8220;We can rest,&#8221; said Pan Dan Chee, &#8220;but there is nothing to discuss. Our
        plans have all been made for us by Ho Ran Kim.&#8221;</p>

        <p>We entered a cell which contained no grim reminders of past tragedy;
        and, after wedging one of our torches in a niche in the wall, we sat
        down on the hard stone floor.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Perhaps your plans have been made for you by Ho Ran Kim,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but
        I make my own plans.&#8221;</p>

        <p>&#8220;And they are&#8212;?&#8221; he asked.</p>

        <p>&#8220;I am not going back to be murdered. I am going to find a way out of
        these pits.&#8221;</p>

        <p>Pan Dan Chee shook his head sorrowfully. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
        you are going back to meet your fate with me.&#8221;</p>

        <p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Because I shall have to take you back. You well know that I cannot let
        a stranger escape from Horz.&#8221;</p>

        <p>&#8220;That means that we shall have to fight to the death, Pan Dan Chee,&#8221; I
        said; &#8220;and I do not wish to kill one at whose side I have fought and
        whom I have learned to admire.&#8221;</p>

        <p>&#8220;I feel the same way, John Carter,&#8221; said Pan Dan Chee. &#8220;I do not wish
        to kill you; but you must see my position&#8212;if you do not come with me
        willingly, I shall have to kill you.&#8221;</p>

        <p>I tried to argue him out of his foolish stand, but he was adamant. I
        was positive that Pan Dan Chee liked me; and I shrank from the idea of
        killing him, as I knew that I should. He was an excellent swordsman,
        but what chance would he have against the master swordsman of two
        worlds? I am sorry if that should sound like boasting; for I abhor
        boasting&#8212;I only spoke what is a fact. I am, unquestionably, the best
        swordsman that has ever lived.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to kill each other at once. Let&#8217;s enjoy
        each other&#8217;s company for a while longer.&#8221;</p>

        <p>Pan Dan Chee smiled. &#8220;That will suit me perfectly,&#8221; he said.</p>
