Give your code a home in the cloud
====================

- Host your code for free, in public or private git repositories.
- Build on the work of others with GitHub Packages and npm,
  the world’s largest package registry.

Collaborate
====================

- Scale your team to any size with free unlimited collaborators
- Use pull requests for conversational code review: propose changes,
  read code, ask for input, make suggestions, and review in one place.
- Know when your pull request is ready to merge when everything’s
  green. Reviews approved? ✓ Tests passing? ✓ No conflicts? Ship it.

Apps
====================

- Use the native iOS or Android apps to review or merge code, manage
  notifications, ask and answer questions, and browse repositories.
- Git and GitHub operations made easy on Windows and Mac with the
  GitHub Desktop app.
- Fast powerful interactions with code, pull requests, issues, and
  discussions in the GitHub CLI.

Instant dev environments in the cloud with Codespaces
====================

- The future of code is in the cloud, not your local copy.
  Codespaces gives you a complete, configurable dev environment
  on top of a powerful VM in minutes.
- Visual Studio Code, in your browser. Codespaces brings the world’s
  most popular desktop editor to every repo. Code, build, test,
  use the terminal, and open pull requests from anywhere.

GitHub Actions
====================

- Setup CI/CD, enhance your DevOps, and script your entire workflow
  with GitHub Actions. Kick off automated workflows with GitHub events
  like push, issue creation, merge, and release.
- Write your own, or import Actions from the open source community,
  all within our world-class editor. Run actions in any language or
  operating system, on Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers.
  Or all at once with matrix builds.
- With nearly 100 million jobs run per month, you’re in good company.

Dependabot
====================

- Speaking of automation, Dependabot keeps your projects up to date
  with automated pull requests that update all your dependencies.
  Just review and merge to keep your software secure.

Advanced security
====================

- Secure your code as you write it. CodeQL’s code scanning automatically
  reviews changes to your codebase and identifies known vulnerabilities
  before they ever reach production.
- Keep your secrets. We automatically scan repos for OAuth tokens,
  API keys, personal tokens, and more. If we find one, we’ll notify
  you and the partner that issued it to invalidate the secret.
- Found a vulnerability? Our security advisory remediation tools help
  developers identify and disclose them responsibly so maintainers can
  patch them in dedicated, private workspaces.

Community
====================

- Amplify your voice in your own personal README on your profile.
  Tell the story of your work through your repositories, contributions,
  and technologies of choice.
- Get paid for building what matters to you with GitHub Sponsors.
  That open source code you wrote for yourself might help someone else.
