<%#
  This is used to perform a "redirect" within a remoteForm() XHR submit.

  If model validation fails, we want to re-render the form as an HTML fragment with validation errors in place. On
  success, we want to redirect to the new list's URL. We need to use remoteForm() to replace the dialog form without
  a page load, but if returns a 301, remoteForm() will follow it and return the rendered page before we can
  do anything differently.

  Returning this allows us to do the redirect ourselves on a successful response without having to render the entire
  show view twice.
