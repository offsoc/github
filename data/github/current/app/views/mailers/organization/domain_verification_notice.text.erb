Hi @<%= @user.display_login %>,

An owner of the organization

"<%= @org.safe_profile_name %>"

just <%= @state %> the <%= @domain %> domain.

Previously, owners of the "<%= @org.safe_profile_name %>" organization could see:

  • If you have two-factor authentication enabled or not
  • Your public profile information
  • Certain activity within this organization
  • Country of request origin
  • Your access level to repositories within the organization
  • Your IP address

Now, owners will also be able to see:

  • Your email address in the <%= @domain %> domain.
