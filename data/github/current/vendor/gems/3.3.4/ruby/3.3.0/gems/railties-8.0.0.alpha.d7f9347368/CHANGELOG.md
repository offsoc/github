*   Enable query log tags by default on development env

    This can be used to trace troublesome SQL statements back to the application
    code that generated these statements. It is also useful when using multiple
    databases because the query logs can identify which database is being used.

*   Defer route drawing to the first request, or when url_helpers are called

    Executes the first routes reload in middleware, or when a route set's
    url_helpers receives a route call / asked if it responds to a route.
    Previously, this was executed unconditionally on boot, which can
    slow down boot time unnecessarily for larger apps with lots of routes.

    Environments like production that have `config.eager_load = true` will
    continue to eagerly load routes on boot.

*   Generate form helpers to use `textarea*` methods instead of `text_area*` methods

*   Add authentication generator to give a basic start to an authentication system using database-tracked sessions and password reset.

    Generate with...

    ```
    bin/rails generate authentication
    ```

    Generated files:

    ```
    app/models/current.rb
    app/models/user.rb
    app/models/session.rb
    app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
    app/controllers/passwords_controller.rb
    app/mailers/passwords_mailer.rb
    app/views/sessions/new.html.erb
    app/views/passwords/new.html.erb
    app/views/passwords/edit.html.erb
    app/views/passwords_mailer/reset.html.erb
    app/views/passwords_mailer/reset.text.erb
    db/migrate/xxxxxxx_create_users.rb
    db/migrate/xxxxxxx_create_sessions.rb
    test/mailers/previews/passwords_mailer_preview.rb
    ```

*   Add not-null type modifier to migration attributes.

    Generating with...

    ```
    bin/rails generate migration CreateUsers email_address:string!:uniq password_digest:string!
    ```

    Produces:

    ```ruby
    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
      def change
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.string :email_address, null: false
          t.string :password_digest, null: false

          t.timestamps
        end
        add_index :users, :email_address, unique: true
      end
    end
    ```

*   Add a `script` folder to applications, and a scripts generator.

    The new `script` folder is meant to hold one-off or general purpose scripts,
    such as data migration scripts, cleanup scripts, etc.

    A new script generator allows you to create such scripts:

    ```
    bin/rails generate script my_script
    bin/rails generate script data/backfill
    ```

    You can run the generated script using:

    ```
    bundle exec ruby script/my_script.rb
    bundle exec ruby script/data/backfill.rb
    ```

    *Jerome Dalbert*, *Haroon Ahmed*

*   Deprecate `bin/rake stats` in favor of `bin/rails stats`.

    *Juan VÃ¡squez*

*   Add internal page `/rails/info/notes`, that displays the same information as `bin/rails notes`.

    *Deepak Mahakale*

*   Add Rubocop and GitHub Actions to plugin generator.
    This can be skipped using --skip-rubocop and --skip-ci.

    *Chris Oliver*

*   Use Kamal for deployment by default, which includes generating a Rails-specific config/deploy.yml.
    This can be skipped using --skip-kamal. See more: https://kamal-deploy.org/
