summary: Check team permissions for a repository
description: |-
  Checks whether a team has `admin`, `push`, `maintain`, `triage`, or `pull` permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.

  You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types/) via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.

  If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.

  If the repository is private, you must have at least `read` permission for that repository, and your token must have the `repo` or `admin:org` scope. Otherwise, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
