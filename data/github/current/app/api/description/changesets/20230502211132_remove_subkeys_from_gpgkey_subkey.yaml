description: This changeset removes the subkeys node from the gpg-key/subkeys object

# To further elaborate on the details of the change or its effects.
notes:  |-
  The subkeys node creates a circular reference in the gpg-key/subkeys object.
  Effectively this means that consumers could infinitely walk the node tree if there was
  a subkey in the collection of subkeys that was once a parent gpg-key.
