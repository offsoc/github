Hi @<%= @admin.display_login %>,

The <%= @org.display_login %> organization recently downgraded from a GitHub paid plan to a free plan. Codespaces can only be billed to organizations that are on a paid plan. The <%= pluralize(@codespace_count, 'codespace') %> that were being billed to the <%= @org.display_login %> organization have been disabled. These codespaces will be deleted on <%= @deletion_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>; 7 days after the organization was downgraded.

If you didn't intend to downgrade, and would like to prevent codespaces from being deleted, you can re-upgrade <%= @org.display_login %> by  navigating to the organization's billing plan in settings and selecting a paid plan before <%= @deletion_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>. No action is required, otherwise.
