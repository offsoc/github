summary: Create an issue comment
description: |-
  You can use the REST API to create comments on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

  This endpoint triggers [notifications](${externalDocsUrl}/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
  Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting.
  For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
  and "[Best practices for using the REST API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
