Hey <%= @user.display_login %>!

A passkey "<%= @nickname %>" was removed from your account.

You may still need to remove it from your password manager to remove it from autofill suggestions.

To see this and other security events for your account, visit <%= settings_user_audit_log_url %>

If you did not initiate this action or believe your account has been compromised, it is a good idea to review
your active sessions and all passkeys associated with your account or consider enabling two-factor authentication.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
