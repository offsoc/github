summary: 'List repository security advisories'
description: |-
  Lists security advisories in a repository.

  The authenticated user can access unpublished security advisories from a repository if they are a security manager or administrator of that repository, or if they are a collaborator on any security advisory.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repository_advisories:read` scope to to get a published security advisory in a private repository, or any unpublished security advisory that the authenticated user has access to.
