# SSR Utils

The JavaScript / TypeScript Code in this folder has been written to be used in both the browser and in Node.js environments and is safe to use in React apps or other server side rendering (SSR) applications. These utilities are intended to provide basic tools to make other code SSR compatible as well.

For details on what is required to make your JS / TS universal, see <https://thehub.github.com/epd/engineering/dev-practicals/frontend/react/ssr/>
