summary: |-
  This event occurs when there is activity relating to a check suite. For information about check suites, see "[Getting started with the Checks API](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api)." For information about the APIs to manage check suites, see [the GraphQL API documentation](${externalDocsUrl}/graphql/reference/objects#checksuite) or "[Check Suites](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/checks/suites)" in the REST API documentation.

  For activity relating to check runs, use the `check_run` event.

  To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level access for the "Checks" permission. To receive the `requested` and `rerequested` event types, the app must have at least write-level access for the "Checks" permission. GitHub Apps with write-level access for the "Checks" permission are automatically subscribed to this webhook event.

  Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for the `completed` event types in repositories.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite was created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.
