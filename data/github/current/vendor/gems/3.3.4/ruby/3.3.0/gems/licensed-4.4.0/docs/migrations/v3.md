# Breaking changesÂ to bundler dependency enumeration in v3

**NOTE** If you are migrating from a version earlier than v2, please first [migrate to v2](./v2.md) before continuing.

Licensed v3 includes a breaking change to bundler dependency enumeration when using the executable form of licensed.  Bundler dependency enumeration will no longer work with the licensed executable as of 3.0.0.

**If your project does not use bundler, or if you already install the licensed gem, you are not affected by this breaking change.**

## Migrating bundler enumeration for v3

When using licensed v3 with bundler dependencies, licensed must be installed from its [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/licensed).  This can be accomplished with `gem install`, or by adding licensed to a bundler gem file.

### Usage in a GitHub Actions workflow

Using licensed to enumerate bundler dependencies in a GitHub Actions workflow will require ruby to be available in the actions VM environment.  Ruby can be setup in an actions workflow using [ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby)(preferred) or [actions/setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby)(deprecated).

If you are using licensed in a GitHub Actions workflow, [jonabc/setup-licensed](https://github.com/jonabc/setup-licensed) has been updated according to this breaking change.  `setup-licensed` will install the licensed gem when ruby is available, or the licensed executable when ruby is not available.  Alternatively, you can `gem install` licensed directly as an actions step.

This is an example workflow definition that runs [jonabc/licensed-ci](https://github.com/jonabc/licensed-ci)'s opinionated license compliance workflow in CI.  It includes jobs that demonstrate installing licensed using 
- `gem install`
- [jonabc/setup-licensed](https://github.com/jonabc/setup-licensed)
- installing when included in a bundler gem file
