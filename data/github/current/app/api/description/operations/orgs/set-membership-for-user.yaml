summary: Set organization membership for a user
description: "Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the organization
  or update the member's role.\n\n*   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a member
  to the organization, the invited user will receive an email inviting them to the
  organization. The user's [membership status](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/orgs/members#get-organization-membership-for-a-user)
  will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.\n    \n*   Authenticated users
  can _update_ a user's membership by passing the `role` parameter. If the authenticated
  user changes a member's role to `admin`, the affected user will receive an email
  notifying them that they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated
  user changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.\n\n**Rate limits**\n\nTo
  prevent abuse, organization owners are limited to creating 50 organization invitations
  for an organization within a 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one month
  old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period."
