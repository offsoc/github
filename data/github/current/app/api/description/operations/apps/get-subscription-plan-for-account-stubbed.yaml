summary: Get a subscription plan for an account (stubbed)
description: |-
  Shows whether the user or organization account actively subscribes to a plan listed by the authenticated GitHub App. When someone submits a plan change that won't be processed until the end of their billing cycle, you will also see the upcoming pending change.

  GitHub Apps must use a [JWT](${externalDocsUrl}/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app) to access this endpoint. OAuth apps must use [basic authentication](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api#using-basic-authentication) with their client ID and client secret to access this endpoint.
