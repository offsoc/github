summary: Add selected repository to an organization secret
description: |-
  Adds a repository to an organization secret when the `visibility` for
  repository access is set to `selected`. For more information about setting the visibility, see [Create or
  update an organization secret](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/actions/secrets#create-or-update-an-organization-secret).

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
