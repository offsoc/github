summary: List global security advisories
description: |-
  Lists all global security advisories that match the specified parameters. If no other parameters are defined, the request will return only GitHub-reviewed advisories that are not malware.

  By default, all responses will exclude advisories for malware, because malware are not standard vulnerabilities. To list advisories for malware, you must include the `type` parameter in your request, with the value `malware`. For more information about the different types of security advisories, see "[About the GitHub Advisory database](${externalDocsUrl}/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database#about-types-of-security-advisories)."
