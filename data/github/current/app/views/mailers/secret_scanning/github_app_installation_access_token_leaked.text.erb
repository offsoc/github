Your GitHub App Installation Access Token has been revoked.

A recent scan found a valid GitHub App Installation Access Token linked to your app, <%= @app_name %>, in <%= @link_text %><% if @url.present? %> at <%= @url %> <% end %>

We have revoked it to protect your data from unauthorized access, and as a consequence, any app using this token won't be able to authenticate to GitHub.

Review any unauthorized applications and remove any you don't recognize: <%= GitHub.help_url %>/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps
