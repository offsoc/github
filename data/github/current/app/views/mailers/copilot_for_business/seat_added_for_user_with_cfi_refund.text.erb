license subscription for <%= @user.display_login %> has been automatically cancelled and no further payments

We have arranged a refund for any amounts due.

No action is needed, and you don’t need to contact us. You can keep using
Copilot, and you should see no interruption to your service.

Enjoy!

We will automatically post a <%= @refund_amount.format %> refund to your <% if @payment_type == "paypal" %>PayPal account<% else %>credit card<% end %> within 14 days.
