You're receiving this email because you are an Enterprise Owner of the <%= @business.name %> enterprise.
It has come to our attention that the audit log stream for your enterprise is currently misconfigured.

GitHub conducts automated checks of audit log stream health every 24 hours, and a recent inspection has revealed that your stream is not properly configured.
Consequently, audit log events are not being written to your designated endpoint.

Streamed audit logs are stored for up to 7 days on GitHub.com.

To avoid any data loss from your audit log stream, you must follow our documentation for setting up audit log streaming
to reconfigure your audit log stream within 6 days.
