summary: Remove selected repository from an organization variable
description: |-
  Removes a repository from an organization variable that is
  available to selected repositories. Organization variables that are available to
  selected repositories have their `visibility` field set to `selected`.

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read variables.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, the `repo` scope is also required.
