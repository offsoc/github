While reading she's also holding up a stirrer with another arm, about to stir dough in a bowl. Also on the table is a delicious cake with two candles and some cherries on top, frosting is running down the sides.](https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/0d2b95c5-f061-4988-b7a8-841ebd1fa5a1)

# Introduction

The internal GitHub Storybook exists to share components and enhance collaboration between Primer, Accessibility and GitHub teams. Sharing components is as easy as pie üç∞. Aim to make your component accessible, consistent and reusable by following the [Recipes Framework](https://thehub.github.com/epd/design-system/recipes/). A list of available components across three categories is available below.

## Templates

Complete layout examples that you can copy and paste. They help you quickly start coding responsive layouts with Primer. You can also use them to learn more about how our layouts respond to different screen sizes.

## Recipes

You can use any stable Recipe with the same confidence you would integrate a Primer component. They are created with accessibility, consistency and reusability in mind. If you have a question about any of them, reach out to the owning teams listed:

## Utilities

Utilities offer functionalities without a direct user interface. Integrating them prevents the need to build from scratch and ensures consistency.

## Apps

Comprehensive solutions encapsulated as standalone applications. An example includes Memex that provides robust features and tools optimized for specific tasks or workflows. Please see the list of apps in the sidebar.
