          This field is included for legacy purposes; use the `role_name` field instead. The `maintain`
          role is mapped to `write` and the `triage` role is mapped to `read`. To determine the role
          assigned to the collaborator, use the `role_name` field instead, which will provide the full
          role name, including custom roles.
