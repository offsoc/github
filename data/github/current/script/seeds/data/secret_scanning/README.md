# Example repos for local secret scanning development

These are example repos for use with `Seeds::Runner::SecretScanning` â€“ they will be restored using `Seeds::Objects::Repository.restore_premade_repo` before further processing that populates a local token-scanning-service instance with the appropriate data for local testing and development of secret scanning features.

Each `.git` folder should contain an additional README that describes what features/characteristics the repo is intended to test.
