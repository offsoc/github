  The `topics` property for repositories on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To view the `topics` property in calls that return repository results, you must provide a custom [media type](${externalDocsUrl}/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types) in the `Accept` header:
  ```shell
  application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json
  ```
